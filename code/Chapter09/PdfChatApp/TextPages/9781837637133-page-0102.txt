Chapter 2 69 • If you are using JetBrains Rider, then in the Database toolbar, click the Jump to Query Console… button, and then remove any existing statements. As well as the following SQL statements, start with a command to set the active database to Northwind: USE Northwind GO. This should prevent JetBrains Rider from creating the stored procedure in the master database! 3. Modify the SQL statements to define a stored procedure named GetExpensiveProducts with two parameters, an input parameter for the minimum unit price and an output parameter for the row count of matching products, as shown in the following code: CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetExpensiveProducts] @price money, @count int OUT AS PRINT 'Getting expensive products: ' + TRIM(CAST(@price AS NVARCHAR(10))) SELECT @count = COUNT(*) FROM Products WHERE UnitPrice >= @price SELECT * FROM Products WHERE UnitPrice >= @price RETURN 0 The stored procedure uses two SELECT statements. The first sets the @count out- put parameter to a count of the matching product rows. The second returns the matching product rows. It also calls the PRINT command, which will raise the InfoMessage event. 4. Right-click in the SQL statements and select Execute or Execute Query. 5. Right-click Stored Procedures and select Refresh. In JetBrains Rider, it is named routines.
