Chapter 13 579 <PackageReference Include="Grpc.Tools" Version="2.58.0"> <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets> <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets> </PackageReference> </ItemGroup> Good Practice: The Grpc.Net.ClientFactory package references the Grpc.Net. Client package that implements client-side support for gRPC in a .NET project, but it does not reference other packages like Grpc.Tools or Google.Protobuf. We must reference those packages explicitly. The Grpc.Tools package is only used during development, so it is marked as PrivateAssets=all to ensure that the tools are not published with the production website. 3. In the Properties folder, open launchSettings.json, and for the https profile, modify the applicationUrl setting to use ports 5133 for https and 5134 for http, as shown highlighted in the following partial markup: "profiles": { ... "https": { "commandName": "Project", "dotnetRunMessages": true, "launchBrowser": true, "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5133;http://localhost:5134", "environmentVariables": { "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" } 4. Copy the Protos folder from the Northwind.Grpc.Service project/folder to the Northwind. project/folder. Grpc.Client.Mvc In Visual Studio 2022, you can drag and drop to copy. In Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider, drag and drop while holding the Ctrl or Cmd key. 5. In the Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc project, in the Protos folder, in greet.proto, modify the namespace to match the namespace for the current project so that the automatically generated classes will be in the same namespace, as shown in the following code: option csharp_namespace = "Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc";
