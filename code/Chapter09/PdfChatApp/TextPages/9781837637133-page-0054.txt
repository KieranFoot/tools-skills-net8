Chapter 1 21 The version used in this book is 1.83.0, September 2023 feature release, but the version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code is less important than the version of the C# extension that you installed. While the C# extension is not required, it provides IntelliSense as you type, code navigation, and de- bugging features, so it’s something that’s very handy to install and keep updated to support the latest C# language features. Visual Studio Code keyboard shortcuts In this book, I will avoid showing keyboard shortcuts used for tasks like creating a new file since they are often different on different operating systems. The situations where I will show keyboard shortcuts are when you need to repeatedly press the key, for example, while debugging. These are also more likely to be consistent across operating systems. If you want to customize your keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code, then you can, as shown at the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings. I recommend that you download a PDF of keyboard shortcuts for your operating system from the following list: • Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf • macOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf • Linux: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf Consuming Azure resources Some of the chapters in this book will require you to sign up for an Azure account and create Azure resources. Frequently, there are free tiers or local development versions of these services, but some- times you will have to create a resource that generates costs for the time it exists. Packt books use technical reviewers who complete all the coding exercises just like a reader would. Here is what one of the TRs of the second edition (2E) of this book said about their Azure costs. “I got my Azure bill. To run through 2E on a “paid” account cost me $3.01.” Microsoft currently says, “Eligible new users get $200 Azure credit in your billing currency for the first 30 days and a limited quantity of free services for 12 months with your Azure free account.” You can learn more at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/avoid-charges- free-account Good Practice: Delete Azure resources as soon as you do not need them to keep your costs low. A summary of which chapters need Azure resources and if a local development alternative is available is shown in Table 1.6:
