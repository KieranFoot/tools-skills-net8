Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 36 Downloading solution code from the GitHub repository If you just want to download all the solution files without using Git, click the green Code button and then select Download ZIP, as shown in Figure 1.14: Figure 1.14: Downloading the repository as a ZIP file Good Practice: It is best to clone or download the code solutions to a short folder path, like C:\cs12dotnet8\ or C:\book\, to avoid build-generated files exceeding the maximum path length. You should also avoid special characters like #. For example, do not use a folder name like C:\C# projects\. That folder name might work for a simple console app project but once you start adding features that automatically generate code, you are likely to have strange issues. Keep your folder names short and simple. Using Git with Visual Studio Code and the command prompt Visual Studio Code has integrations with Git, but it will use your operating systemâ€™s Git installation, so you must install Git 2.0 or later first before you get these features. You can install Git from the following link: https://git-scm.com/download. If you like to use a GUI, you can download GitHub Desktop from the following link: https://desktop. github.com.
