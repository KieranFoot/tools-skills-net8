Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 48 GitHub Copilot is free for students, teachers, and some open-source project maintainers. For everyone else, it has a 30-day free trial and then it costs $10 per month or $100 per year for individuals. Once you have an account, you can then sign up for waiting lists to get the more advanced experimental GitHub Copilot X features. You should check online which Copilot features are available for various code editors. As you can imagine, this is a fast-changing world and a lot of what I might write in the book today will be out of date by the time you read it: https://github.com/features/copilot. JetBrains has its own equivalent, named AI Assistant, which you can read about at the following link: https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/06/ai-assistant-in- jetbrains-ides/. So, what can GitHub Copilot do for you today? Imagine that you have just added a new class file named Product.cs. You click inside the Product class, press Enter to insert a blank line, and then pause for a second as you think about what you need to type…and GitHub Copilot generates some sample code in gray, as shown in Figure 1.23: Figure 1.23: GitHub Copilot suggesting how to define a Product class At this point, you can glance over the code and, if it is close to what you want, just press Tab to insert it all, or press Alt + . (dot) to toggle between other suggestions. Sometimes it is too far off what you need, and you’ll be better off ignoring its suggestion completely and just writing it yourself. But usually, there’s something there that’s usable or reminds you of the syntax you need to use. And sometimes, it feels like magic, writing dozens of lines of exactly what you need.
