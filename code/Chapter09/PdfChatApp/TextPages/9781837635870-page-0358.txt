Chapter 6 339 WriteLine(lastName.Length); #pragma warning restore CS8602 These techniques can be used for any compiler warnings, not just those related to nullability. Declaring non-nullable variables and parameters If you enable NRTs and you want a reference type to be assigned the null value, then you will have to use the same syntax to make a value type nullable, that is, adding a ? symbol after the type declaration. So, how do NRTs work? Letâ€™s look at an example. When storing information about an address, you might want to force a value for the street, city, and region, but the building can be left blank, that is, null: 1. In the NullHandling project, add a class file named Address.cs. Address.cs, delete any existing statements and then add statements to declare an Address 2. in class with four fields, as shown in the following code: namespace Packt.Shared; public class Address { public string? Building; public string Street; public string City; public string Region; } 3. After a few seconds, note the warnings about non-nullable fields, like Street not being initial- ized, as shown in Figure 6.3: Figure 6.3: Warning messages about non-nullable fields in the Error List window
