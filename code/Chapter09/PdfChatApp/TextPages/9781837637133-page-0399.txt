Building and Securing Web Services Using Minimal APIs 366 5. With the ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs service technology, how do you map a method or lambda parameter to a value in a route, query string, or the body of the request? 6. Does enabling CORS increase security for a web service? You have added statements to Program.cs to enable HTTP logging but HTTP requests and 7. responses are not being logged. What is the most likely reason and how can you fix it? How do you limit the rate of requests for a specific client using the AspNetCoreRateLimit 8. package? How do you limit the rate of requests for a specific endpoint using the Microsoft.AspNetCore. 9. RateLimiting package? 10. What does JWT mean? Exercise 8.2 – Review Microsoft HTTP API design policy Microsoft has internal HTTP/REST API design guidelines. Microsoft teams reference this document when designing their HTTP APIs. They are a great starting point for your own standards for HTTP APIs. You can review them at the following link: https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines The guidelines have a section specific to CORS and you can review them at the following link: https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#8-cors Exercise 8.3 – Explore topics Use the links on the following page to learn more details about the topics covered in this chapter: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/book-links.md#chapter- 8---building-and-securing-web-services-using-minimal-apis Exercise 8.4 – Exposing data via the web using OData services Learn how to quickly implement a Web API service that can wrap an EF Core entity model using OData in this online-only chapter: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch08-odata.md Exercise 8.5 – Auth0 project templates If you need to implement Auth0 for authentication and authorization, then you can use project tem- plates to scaffold your code. An article describing these project templates and how to use them is found at the following link: https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-templates-for-dotnet/
