It will collapse into a hamburger menu when there is not enough hori- zontal space, and then the visitor can toggle the navigation on and off. There are currently two menu items: Home and Weather. We will add more throughout • this chapter. 12. In the Components\Pages folder, in Home.razor, note the @page directive that configures a route for the root path to go to this page component, and then change the heading from world Blazor Full Stack, as shown highlighted in the following markup: to @page "/" <PageTitle>Home</PageTitle> <h1>Hello, Blazor Full Stack!</h1> Welcome to your new app. 13. Start the Northwind.Blazor project, using its https profile without debugging: • If you are using Visual Studio 2022, then in Solution Explorer, select the Northwind. Blazor project to make it active. In the Visual Studio 2022 toolbar, select the https profile as the Startup Project, and Google Chrome as the Web Browser.
