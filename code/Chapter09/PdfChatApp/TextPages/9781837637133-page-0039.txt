Introducing Apps and Services with .NET 6 A client to a gRPC service. The last part of the name indicates that Northwind.gRPC.Client.Mvc it is an ASP.NET Core MVC website project. Northwind.BlazorWasm.Client An ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly client-side project. Northwind.BlazorWasm.Server An ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly server-side project. A class library shared between client- and server-side Blazor Northwind.BlazorWasm.Shared projects. Table 1.1: Example naming conventions for common project types To enable you to run any of these projects simultaneously, we must make sure that we do not configure duplicated port numbers. I have used the following convention: https://localhost:5[chapternumber]1/ http://localhost:5[chapternumber]2/ For example, for the encrypted connection to the website built in Chapter 14, Building Web User Inter- 5141, as shown in the following link: faces Using ASP.NET Core, I used port https://localhost:5141/ Treating warnings as errors By default, compiler warnings may appear if there are potential problems with your code when you first build a project, but they do not prevent compilation and they are hidden if you rebuild. Warnings are given for a reason, so ignoring warnings encourages poor development practices. Some developers would prefer to be forced to fix warnings, so .NET provides a project setting to do this, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <OutputType>Exe</OutputType> <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> </PropertyGroup> I have enabled the option to treat warnings as errors in (almost) all the solutions in the GitHub re- pository. The exceptions are the gRPC projects. This is due to a combination of factors. In .NET 7 or later, the compiler will warn if you compile source files that contain only lowercase letters in the name of a person class, as shown in the following code: type. For example, if you define a public class person { }
