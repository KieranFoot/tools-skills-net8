Chapter 1 31 It responds with a summary of those top three mistakes, as shown in detail in Figure 1.3 and the following list: Figure 1.3: ChatGPT advising about microservice architecture design “Designing a microservice architecture is a complex task, and there are several common mistakes that can lead to significant issues, even causing a project to be abandoned. Here are the top three most common mistakes: Improper Service Boundaries: One of the most challenging aspects of designing a micros- • ervice architecture is defining the boundaries of each service. If the services are too large (a mistake often called a “monolith in disguise”), you lose many of the benefits of microservices due to tight coupling of different concerns. On the other hand, if the services are too small (sometimes referred to as “nanoservices”), you might have to deal with excessive inter-service communication, resulting in high latency and complexity. • A lack of proper boundaries can also lead to data consistency issues. If multiple services are interacting with the same database tables, it can be difficult to maintain data consistency. To avoid this mistake, it’s important to understand the business domain thoroughly and design • services around business capabilities. Techniques such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) can help identify service boundaries more effectively. Inadequate Consideration for Data Management: Each microservice should own its own data • to ensure loose coupling. Sharing databases across services leads to tight coupling and makes it difficult to change the schema without affecting other services.
