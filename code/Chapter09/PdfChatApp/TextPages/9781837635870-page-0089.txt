Speaking C# 70 Note that <ItemGroup> is different from <ImportGroup>. Be sure to use the correct one! Also, note that the order of elements in a project group or item group does not matter. For example, <Nullable> can be before or after <ImplicitUsings>. 6. Save the changes to the project file. obj folder, expand the Debug folder, expand the net8.0 folder, and open the file 7. Expand the named Vocabulary.GlobalUsings.g.cs. System.Numerics instead of System.Threading, the Environment 8. Note this file now imports class has been imported and aliased to Env, and we have statically imported the Console class, as shown highlighted in the following code: // <autogenerated /> global using global::System; global using global::System.Collections.Generic; global using global::System.IO; global using global::System.Linq; global using global::System.Net.Http; global using global::System.Numerics; global using global::System.Threading.Tasks; global using Env = global::System.Environment; global using static global::System.Console; 9. In Program.cs, add a statement to output a message from the computer and note that because we statically imported the Console class, we can call its methods like WriteLine without pre- Console, and we can reference the Environment class using its alias Env, as fixing them with shown in the following code: WriteLine($"Computer named {Env.MachineName} says \"No.\""); 10. Run the project and note the message, as shown in the following output: Computer named DAVROS says "No." Your computer name will be different unless you name your computers after characters from Doctor Who like I do. You can disable the implicitly imported namespaces feature for all SDKs by removing the <ImplicitUsings> element completely from the project file, or changing its value to disable, as shown in the following markup: <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>
