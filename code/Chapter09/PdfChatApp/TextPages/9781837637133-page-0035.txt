Introducing Apps and Services with .NET 2 Introducing this book and its contents This book caters to two audiences: • Readers who have completed my book for beginners, C# 12 and .NET 8 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals, and now want to take their learning further. • Readers who already have basic skills and knowledge about C# and .NET and want to learn practical skills and knowledge to build real-world applications and services. Companion books to continue your learning journey This book is the second of three books in a trilogy that continues your learning journey through .NET 8: 1. The first book covers the fundamentals of the C# language, the .NET libraries, and ASP.NET Core for web development. It is designed to be read linearly because skills and knowledge from earlier chapters build up and are needed to understand later chapters. This second book covers more specialized topics like internationalization and popular third-par- 2. ty packages including Serilog and NodaTime. You will learn how to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and how to improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background services. You will implement more services using GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and Azure Functions. Finally, you will learn how to build graphical user interfaces for websites, desktop, and mobile apps with Blazor and .NET MAUI. 3. The third book covers important tools and skills that a professional .NET developer should have. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debugging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing whether unit, performance, or web and mobile, and then hosting and deployment topics like Docker and Azure Pipelines. Finally, we look at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want. A summary of the .NET 8 trilogy and their most important topics is shown in Figure 1.1:
