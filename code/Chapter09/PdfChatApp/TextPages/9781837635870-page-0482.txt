9 Working with Files, Streams, and Serialization This chapter is about reading and writing to files and streams, text encoding, and serialization. Appli- cations that do not interact with the filesystem are extraordinarily rare. As a .NET developer, almost every application that you build will need to manage the filesystem and create, open, read, and write to and from files. Most of those files will contain text, so it is important to understand how text is encoded. And finally, after working with objects in memory, you will need to store them somewhere permanently for later reuse. You do that using a technique called serialization. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: • Managing the filesystem • Reading and writing with streams • Encoding and decoding text • Serializing object graphs • Working with environment variables Managing the filesystem Your applications will often need to perform input and output operations with files and directories in different environments. The System and System.IO namespaces contain classes for this purpose. Handling cross-platform environments and filesystems Let’s explore how to handle cross-platform environments and the differences between Windows, Linux, and macOS. Paths are different for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so we will start by exploring how .NET handles this: 1. Use your preferred code editor to create a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Console App / console
