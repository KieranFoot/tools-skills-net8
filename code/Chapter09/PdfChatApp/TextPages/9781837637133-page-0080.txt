If you are using JetBrains Rider, then right-click the SQL Server, in the popup menu, select SQL Scripts | Run SQL Script…, and then select the Northwind4AzureSQLdatabase.sql file. 4. Copy and paste the contents of the Northwind4AzureSQLdatabase.sql file into the query window and execute it. The main difference between the Northwind4SQLServer.sql and Northwind4AzureSQLdatabase.sql scripts is that the local SQL Server script will delete and recreate the Northwind database. The Azure SQL database script will not because the database needs to be created as an Azure resource. You can down- load SQL script files from the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/ apps-services-net8/tree/main/scripts/sql-scripts.
