Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions 184 2. In Program.Functions.cs, write a function named RunFactorial that uses a for statement to output the factorials of numbers from 1 to 15, calls the Factorial function inside its loop, and then outputs the result, formatted using the code N0, which means number format using thousand separators with zero decimal places, as shown in the following code: static void RunFactorial() { for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i++) { WriteLine($"{i}! = {Factorial(i):N0}"); } } 3. Comment out the RunCardinalToOrdinal method call and call the RunFactorial method. 4. Run the project and view the results, as shown in the following partial output: 1! = 1 2! = 2 3! = 6 4! = 24 ... 12! = 479,001,600 13! = 1,932,053,504 14! = 1,278,945,280 15! = 2,004,310,016 It is not immediately obvious in the previous output, but factorials of 13 and higher overflow the int 12! is 479,001,600, which is about half a billion. The maximum positive type because they are so big. value that can be stored in an int variable is about two billion. 13! is 6,227,020,800, which is about six billion, and when stored in a 32-bit integer, it overflows silently without showing any problems. What should you do to get notified when an overflow happens? Of course, we could solve the problem for 13! and 14! by using a long (64-bit integer) instead of an int (32-bit integer), but we will quickly hit the overflow limit again. The point of this section is to understand and show you that numbers can overflow, and not specifically how to calculate factorials higher than 12!. Letâ€™s take a look: 1. Modify the Factorial function to check for overflows in the statement that calls itself, as shown highlighted in the following code: checked // for overflow { return number * Factorial(number - 1); }
