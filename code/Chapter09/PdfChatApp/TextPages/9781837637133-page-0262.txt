Chapter 6 229 namespace Northwind.ViewModels; public record class Summary { // These properties can be initialized once but then never changed. public string? FullName { get; init; } public decimal Total { get; init; } // This record class will have a default parameterless constructor. // The following commented statement is automatically generated: // public Summary() { } } For the entity models, we used record class types defined using the constructor syntax to make them immutable. But an instance of Summary will need to be created using a default parameterless constructor and then its members set by AutoMapper. Therefore, it must be a record class with public properties that can be set during initialization but not after that. To do this, we use the init keyword. Defining mappers for an AutoMapper configuration Now we can define the mappings between models: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a new Class Library / classlib project named MappingObjects.Mappers to the Chapter06 solution. In the MappingObjects.Mappers project, treat warnings as errors, add a reference to the latest 2. AutoMapper package, and add a reference to the Models project, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="AutoMapper" Version="12.0.1" /> </ItemGroup> <ItemGroup> <ProjectReference Include= "..\MappingObjects.Models\MappingObjects.Models.csproj" /> </ItemGroup> 3. Build the MappingObjects.Mappers project to restore packages and compile referenced projects. 4. In the MappingObjects.Mappers project, delete the file named Class1.cs.
