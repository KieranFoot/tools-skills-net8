Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions 186 Letâ€™s improve the tooltip by adding extra information: 1. If you are using Visual Studio Code with the C# extension, you should navigate to View | Com- mand Palette | Preferences: Open Settings (UI), and then search for formatOnType and make sure that it is enabled. C# XML documentation comments are a built-in feature of Visual Studio 2022 and JetBrains Rider, so you do not need to do anything to use them. CardinalToOrdinal function, type three forward slashes ///, and note 2. On the line above the that they are expanded into an XML comment that recognizes that the function has a single parameter named number, as shown in the following code: /// <summary> /// /// </summary> /// <param name="number"></param> /// <returns></returns> 3. Enter suitable information for the XML documentation comment for the CardinalToOrdinal function. Add a summary, and describe the input parameter and the return value, as shown highlighted in the following code: /// <summary> /// Pass a 32-bit unsigned integer and it will be converted into its ordinal equivalent. /// </summary> /// <param name="number">Number as a cardinal value e.g. 1, 2, 3, and so on.</param> /// <returns>Number as an ordinal value e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on.</ returns> 4. Now, when calling the function, you will see more details, as shown in Figure 4.2: Figure 4.2: A tooltip showing the more detailed method signature It is worth emphasizing that this feature is primarily designed to be used with a tool that converts the comments into documentation, like Sandcastle, which you can read more about at the following link: https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB. The tooltips that appear while entering code or hovering over the function name are a secondary feature.
