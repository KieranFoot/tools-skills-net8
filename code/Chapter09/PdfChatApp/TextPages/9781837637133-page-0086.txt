Chapter 2 53 UPDATE Employees Update my employee row to set my Country to UK. SET Country = 'UK' WHERE FirstName = 'Mark' AND LastName = 'Price' DELETE Employees Delete my employee row. WHERE FirstName = 'Mark' AND LastName = 'Price' DELETE Employees Delete all rows in the Employees table and record those deletions in the transaction log. TRUNCATE TABLE Employees Delete all rows in the Employees table more efficiently because it does not log the individual row deletions. Table 2.4: Example DML statements with descriptions The above examples use the Employees table in the Northwind database. That table has referential integrity constraints that would mean that, for example, deleting all rows in the table cannot happen because every employee has related data in other tables like Orders. Data Definition Language (DDL) DDL statements change the structure of the database, including creating new objects like tables, func- tions, and stored procedures. The following table shows some examples of DDL statements to give you an idea, but the examples are simple and cannot be executed within the Northwind database, as shown in Table 2.5: Example Description CREATE TABLE dbo.Shippers ( Create a table to store shippers. ShipperId INT PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED, CompanyName NVARCHAR(40) ); ALTER TABLE Shippers Add a column to a table. ADD Country NVARCHAR(40) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Country Add a non-clustered index for a column in a table. ON Shippers(Country)
