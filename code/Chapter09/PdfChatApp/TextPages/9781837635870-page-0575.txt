Generating a random number in queries EF Core 6 introduced a useful function, EF.Functions.Random, that maps to a database function re- turning a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1, exclusive. For example, you could multiply the random number by the count of rows in a table to select one random row from that table. 1. In Program.Queries.cs, add a method named GetRandomProduct, as shown in the following code: private static void GetRandomProduct() { using NorthwindDb db = new(); SectionTitle("Get a random product"); int? rowCount = db.Products?.Count(); if (rowCount is null) { Fail("Products table is empty."); return; } Product? p = db.Products?.FirstOrDefault( p => p.ProductId == (int)(EF.Functions.Random() * rowCount)); if (p is null) { Fail("Product not found."); return; } WriteLine($"Random product: {p.ProductId} - {p.ProductName}"); } 2. In Program.cs, add a call to GetRandomProduct.
