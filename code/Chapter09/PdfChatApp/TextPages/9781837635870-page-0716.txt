14 Building and Consuming Web Services This chapter is about learning how to build web services (aka HTTP or Representational State Transfer (REST) services) using the ASP.NET Core Web API. You will then learn how to consume web services using HTTP clients, which could be any other type of .NET app, including a website or a mobile or desktop app. This chapter requires the knowledge and skills that you learned in Chapter 10, Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core, and Chapters 12 to 13, about building websites using ASP.NET Core. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: • Building web services using the ASP.NET Core Web API • Creating a web service for the Northwind database • Documenting and testing web services • Consuming web services using HTTP clients Building web services using the ASP.NET Core Web API Before we build a modern web service, we need to cover some background to set the context for this chapter. Understanding web service acronyms Although HTTP was originally designed to request and respond with HTML and other resources for humans to look at, it is also good for building services. Roy Fielding stated in his doctoral dissertation, describing the REST architectural style, that the HTTP standard would be good for building services because it defines the following: • URIs to uniquely identify resources, like https://localhost:5151/api/products/23. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. • Methods for performing common tasks on those resources, like
