9 Caching, Queuing, and Resilient Background Services In this chapter, you will be introduced to multiple technologies and techniques that will improve the scalability and reliability of your services, no matter what service technology you choose to imple- ment them with. This chapter will cover the following topics: • Understanding service architecture • Caching with ASP.NET Core • Fault tolerance with Polly • Queuing with RabbitMQ • Implementing long-running background services Understanding service architecture In Chapter 8, Building and Securing Web Services Using Minimal APIs, you learned how to build a web service using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs. Before looking at alternative technologies to build services, it is worth taking a step back and reviewing service architecture and what causes bottlenecks in service performance and scalability. What parts of a system are slowest? Traditionally, the slowest parts of a system are: • The network (slowest) • The disk • Memory • CPU cache memory (fastest) Each step can be 5 to 10 times slower than the next.
