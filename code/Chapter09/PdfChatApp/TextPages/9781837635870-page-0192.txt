Chapter 4 173 using static System.Console; partial class Program { static void <Main>$(String[] args) { WriteLine("* Top-level functions example"); WhatsMyNamespace(); // Call the function. } static void WhatsMyNamespace() // Define a static function. { WriteLine("Namespace of Program class: {0}", arg0: typeof(Program).Namespace ?? "null"); } } Solution Explorer shows that your Program.Functions.cs class file merges its partial Program with the auto-generated partial Program class, as shown in Figure 4.1: Figure 4.1: Solution Explorer showing the merged partial Program class Good Practice: Create any functions that you will call in Program.cs in a separate file and manually define them inside a partial Program class. This will merge them into the automatically generated Program class at the same level as the <Main>$ method, instead of as local functions inside the <Main>$ method. It is important to note the lack of namespace declarations. Both the automatically generated Program class and the explicitly defined Program class are in the default null namespace.
