In Program.Helpers.cs, in the partial Program class, add a static method named OutputPQ, as shown in the following code: private static void OutputPQ<TElement, TPriority>(string title, IEnumerable<(TElement Element, TPriority Priority)> collection) { WriteLine($"{title}:"); foreach ((TElement, TPriority) item in collection) { WriteLine($" {item.Item1}: {item.Item2}"); } } Note that the OutputPQ method is generic. You can specify the two types used in the tuples that are passed in as collection. 4. In Program.cs, add some statements to illustrate some of the common ways of working with priority queues, as shown in the following code: PriorityQueue<string, int> vaccine = new(); // Add some people. // 1 = High priority people in their 70s or poor health. // 2 = Medium priority e.g. middle-aged. // 3 = Low priority e.g. teens and twenties.
