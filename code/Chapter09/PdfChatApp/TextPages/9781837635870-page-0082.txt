Chapter 2 63 { // An open brace indicates the start of a block. class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); // A statement. } } } // A close brace indicates the end of a block. Note that C# uses a brace style where both the open and close braces are on their own line and are at the same indentation level, as shown in the following code: if (x < 3) { // Do something if x is less than 3. } Other languages like JavaScript use curly braces but format them differently. They put the open curly brace at the end of the declaration statement, as shown in the following code: if (x < 3) { // Do something if x is less than 3. } You can use whatever style you prefer because the compiler does not care. Sometimes, to save vertical space in a print book, I use the JavaScript brace style, but mostly I stick with the C# brace style. I use two spaces instead of the more common four spaces for indenting because my code will be printed in a book and therefore has narrow width available. More Information: The official coding style conventions can be found at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding- style/coding-conventions. Regardless of any official guidelines, I recommend that you conform to whatever standards have been adopted by your development team unless you are a solo developer, in which case as long as your code compiles, you can use any conventions you like. Be kind to your future self though by being consistent one way or the other! Good Practice: The brace style used in the Microsoft official documentation is the most commonly used for C#. For example, see the for statement, as found at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/ statements/iteration-statements.
