Chapter 7 265 Letâ€™s see an example of the problem and solution: 1. In Program.cs, add statements to explicitly set the current culture to Danish, and then output the current day of the week in that culture, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Localizing the DayOfWeek enum"); CultureInfo previousCulture = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture; // Explicitly set culture to Danish (Denmark). Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("da-DK"); // DayOfWeek is not localized to Danish. WriteLine("Culture: {Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture .NativeName}, DayOfWeek: {DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek}"; // Use dddd format code to get day of the week localized. WriteLine($"Culture: {Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture .NativeName}, DayOfWeek: {DateTime.Now:dddd}"); // Use GetDayName method to get day of the week localized. WriteLine("Culture: {Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture .NativeName}, DayOfWeek: {DateTimeFormatInfo.CurrentInfo .GetDayName(DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek)}"); Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = previousCulture; 2. Run the code, and note the results, as shown in the following output: *** Localizing the DayOfWeek enum Culture: dansk (Danmark), DayOfWeek: Thursday Culture: dansk (Danmark), DayOfWeek: torsdag Culture: dansk (Danmark), DayOfWeek: torsdag Working with only a date or a time .NET 6 introduced some new types to work with only a date value or only a time value, named DateOnly and TimeOnly. These are better than using a DateTime value with a zero time to store a date-only value because it DateOnly also maps better to database column types, for example, a is type-safe and avoids misuse. date column in SQL Server. TimeOnly is good for setting alarms and scheduling regular meetings or the opening hours for an organization, and it maps to a time column in SQL Server.
