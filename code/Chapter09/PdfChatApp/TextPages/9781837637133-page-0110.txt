In the Northwind.Console.SqlClient project, add a package reference for Dapper, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" Version="5.1.2" /> <PackageReference Include="Dapper" Version="2.1.21" /> </ItemGroup> At the time of writing, the latest version of Dapper is 2.1.21, released on November 11, 2023. You can check if it has been updated since then at the following link: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper. 2. Build the project to restore packages. Add a new class file named Supplier.cs, and modify its contents to define a class to represent 3. four columns from each row in the Suppliers table, as shown in the following code: namespace Northwind.Models; public class Supplier
