Chapter 12 643 We will make some small changes to improve the entity model mapping and validation rules for SQLite. Similar ones for SQL Server are in the online-only instructions. Remember that all code is available in the GitHub repository for the book. Although you will learn more by typing the code yourself, you never have to.

First, we will add a regular expression to validate that a CustomerId value is exactly five uppercase letters. Second, we will add string length requirements to validate that multiple properties throughout the entity models know the maximum length allowed for their text values: 1. Activate your code editor’s Find and Replace feature: • In Visual Studio 2022, navigate to Edit | Find and Replace | Quick Replace, and then toggle on Use Regular Expressions. 2. Type a regular expression in the Find box, as shown in Figure 12.2 and in the following ex- pression: \[Column\(TypeName = "(nchar|nvarchar) \((.*)\)"\)\] 3. In the Replace box, type a replacement regular expression, as shown in the following expres- sion: $0\n [StringLength($2)] After the newline character, \n, I have included four space characters to indent correctly on my system, which uses two space characters per indentation level. You can insert as many as you wish. 4. Set the Find and Replace to search files in the Current project. 5. Execute the Find and Replace to replace all, as shown in Figure 12.2: Figure 12.2: Find and replace all matches using regular expressions in Visual Studio 2022
