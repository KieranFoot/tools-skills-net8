Chapter 1 7 This compiler warning has been introduced so that a future version of C# can safely add a new keyword knowing it will not conflict with the name of a type that you have used because only C# keywords should contain only lowercase letters. Unfortunately, the Google tools for generating C# source files from .proto files generate aliases for class names that only contain lowercase letters, as shown in the following code: #region Designer generated code using pb = global::Google.Protobuf; If you treat warnings as errors, then the compiler complains and refuses to compile the source code, as shown in the following output: Error CS8981 The type name 'pb' only contains lower-cased ascii characters. Such names may become reserved for the language. Northwind.Grpc.Service C:\ apps-services-net8\Chapter14\Northwind.Grpc.Service\obj\Debug\net8.0\Protos\ Greet.cs Good Practice: Always treat warnings as errors in your .NET projects (except for gRPC projects until Google updates their code generation tools). If you find that you get too many errors after enabling this, you can disable specific warnings by using <WarningsNotAsErrors> element with a comma-separated list of warning codes, as shown in the the following markup: <WarningsNotAsErrors>0219,CS8981</WarningsNotAsErrors> More Information: You can learn more about controlling warnings as errors at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/ compiler-options/errors-warnings#warningsaserrors-and-warningsnotaserrors. App and service technologies Microsoft calls platforms for building applications and services app models or workloads. Understanding .NET .NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin are related and overlapping platforms for developers used to build applications and services. If you are not familiar with the history of .NET, then I will point you to each of these .NET concepts at the following link, which is from the C# 12 and .NET 8 â€“ Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals book: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch01-dotnet-history.md
