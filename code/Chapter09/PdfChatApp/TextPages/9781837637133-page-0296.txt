Chapter 7 263 When the current culture is English (Great Britain), if a date is given as 4 July 2024, then it is correctly parsed regardless of whether the current culture is British or American. But if the date is given as 7/4/2024, then it is parsed as 7 April. You can override the current culture by specifying the correct culture as a provider when parsing, as shown in the third example above. 5. Add statements to loop from the year 2023 to 2028, displaying if the year is a leap year and how many days there are in February, and then showing if Christmas and Independence Day are during DST, as shown in the following code: for (int year = 2023; year <= 2028; year++) { Write($"{year} is a leap year: {DateTime.IsLeapYear(year)}. "); WriteLine($"There are {DateTime.DaysInMonth(year: year, month: 2) } days in February {year}."); } WriteLine($"Is Christmas daylight saving time? { xmas.IsDaylightSavingTime()}"); WriteLine($"Is July 4th daylight saving time? { independenceDay.IsDaylightSavingTime()}"); 6. Run the code, and note the results, as shown in the following output: 2023 is a leap year: False. There are 28 days in February 2023. 2024 is a leap year: True. There are 29 days in February 2024. 2025 is a leap year: False. There are 28 days in February 2025. 2026 is a leap year: False. There are 28 days in February 2026. 2027 is a leap year: False. There are 28 days in February 2027. 2028 is a leap year: True. There are 29 days in February 2028. Is Christmas daylight saving time? False Is July 4th daylight saving time? True Complexities of Daylight Saving Time (DST) DST is not used in all countries; it is also determined by hemisphere, and politics plays a role. For example, the United States is currently debating whether it should make DST permanent. They might decide to leave the decision up to individual states. It could all get extra confusing for Americans over the next few years. Each country has its own rules for what day and what hour DST happens. These rules are encoded by .NET so that it can adjust automatically when needed.
