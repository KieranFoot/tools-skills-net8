Decorate a controller or method with the [ResponseCache] attribute to control caching responses from the server (code to control caching requests has to go in the client code). This attribute has common parameters, as shown in Table 9.4: Property Description Duration How long to cache in seconds. Location Where the response can be cached. Any (cache-control: public), Client (cache-control: private), None (cache-control: no-cache). NoStore Sets cache-control: no-store. VaryByHeader Sets the Vary header. VaryByQueryKeys Query keys to vary by. Table 9.4: Common parameters of the [ResponseCache] attribute Letâ€™s apply response caching to the web service: 1. In the Northwind.WebApi.Service project, in Program.cs, after the call to add the distributed memory cache, add a statement to add response caching middleware as a dependency service, as shown in the following code: builder.Services.AddResponseCaching(); 2. In Program.cs, after the call to use HTTPS redirection, add a statement to use response caching middleware, as shown in the following code: app.UseResponseCaching(); Good Practice: If using CORS middleware, then UseCors must be called before UseResponseCaching.
