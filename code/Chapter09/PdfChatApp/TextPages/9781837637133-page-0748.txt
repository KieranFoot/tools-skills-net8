Chapter 16 715 Creating a virtual Android device for local app testing To target Android, you must install at least one Android SDK. A default installation of Visual Studio 2022 with the mobile development workload already includes one Android SDK, but it is often an older version designed to support as many Android devices as possible.

If you see the modal dialog box Welcome Experience, then click Continue without code. 2. Navigate to Tools | Android | Android Device Manager. If you are prompted by User Account Control to allow this app to make changes to your device, click Yes. 3. In the Android Device Manager, click the + New button to create a new device. 4.
