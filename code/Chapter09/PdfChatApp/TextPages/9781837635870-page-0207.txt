Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions 188 if (term == 0) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(); } else if (term == 1) { return 0; } else if (term == 2) { return 1; } else { return FibImperative(term - 1) + FibImperative(term - 2); } } 2. In Program.Functions.cs, write a function named RunFibImperative that calls FibImperative inside a for statement that loops from 1 to 30, as shown in the following code: static void RunFibImperative() { for (uint i = 1; i <= 30; i++) { WriteLine("The {0} term of the Fibonacci sequence is {1:N0}.", arg0: CardinalToOrdinal(i), arg1: FibImperative(term: i)); } } 3. In Program.cs, comment out the other method calls, and call the RunFibImperative method. 4. Run the console app and view the results, as shown in the following partial output: The 1st term of the Fibonacci sequence is 0. The 2nd term of the Fibonacci sequence is 1. The 3rd term of the Fibonacci sequence is 1. The 4th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 2. The 5th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 3. ... The 29th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 317,811. The 30th term of the Fibonacci sequence is 514,229.
