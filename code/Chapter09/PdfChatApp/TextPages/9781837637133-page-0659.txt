Building Web User Interfaces Using ASP.NET Core 626 Reviewing an MVC website project structure In your code editor, in Visual Studio 2022 Solution Explorer (toggle on Show All Files) or Visual Studio Code EXPLORER – SOLUTION EXPLORER, review the structure of an MVC website project, as shown in Figure 14.2: Figure 14.2: VS Code and VS 2022 Solution Explorers for an ASP.NET Core MVC project We will look in more detail at some of these parts later, but for now, note the following: • Areas: This folder contains nested folders and a file needed to integrate your website project with ASP.NET Core Identity, which is used for authentication. bin, obj: These folders contain temporary files needed during the build process and the com- • piled assemblies for the project. Solution Explorer for Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit does not show hidden folders like these, but you can see them in the folder view (labeled CHAPTER14 in Figure 14.2). Controllers: This folder contains C# classes that have methods (known as actions) that fetch • a model and pass it to a view, for example, HomeController.cs. Data: This folder contains Entity Framework Core migration classes used by the ASP.NET Core • Identity system to provide data storage for authentication and authorization, for example, ApplicationDbContext.cs. Models: This folder contains C# classes that represent all the data gathered together by a con- • troller and passed to a view, for example, ErrorViewModel.cs.
