Building and Consuming Web Services 714 Use colons to separate multiple constraints, as shown in the following example: [Route("employees/{years:int:minlength(3)}")] public Employees[] GetLoyalEmployees(int years) For regular expressions, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions. CultureInvariant is added automatically. Regular expression tokens must be escaped (replace \ with \\, { with {{, and } with }}) or use verbatim string literals. You can create custom route constraints by defining a class that implements IRouteConstraint. This is beyond the scope of this book and you can read about it at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/ routing#custom-route-constraints. Short-circuit routes in ASP.NET Core 8 When routing matches a request to an endpoint, it lets the rest of the middleware pipeline run before invoking the endpoint logic. That takes time, so in ASP.NET Core 8, you can invoke the endpoint im- mediately and return the response. You do this by calling the ShortCircuit method on a mapped endpoint route, as shown in the fol- lowing code: app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World").ShortCircuit(); Alternatively, you can call the MapShortCircuit method to respond with a 404 Missing Resource or other status code for resources that don’t need further processing, as shown in the following code: app.MapShortCircuit(404, "robots.txt", "favicon.ico"); Improved route tooling in ASP.NET Core 8 For .NET 8, Microsoft has improved the tooling for working with routes for all ASP.NET Core technol- ogies including Minimal APIs, Web APIs, and Blazor. The features include the following list: • Route syntax highlighting: Different parts of routes are now highlighted in your code editor. • Autocompletion of parameter and route names, and route constraints. • Route analyzers and fixers: These address the common problems that developers have when implementing their routes. You can read about them in the blog article ASP.NET Core Route Tooling Enhancements in .NET 8, found at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet-core-route-tooling- dotnet-8/.
