Chapter 5 197 5. In MainWindow.xaml, in the <Grid> element, add elements to define two buttons, a text box and a list box, laid out vertically in a stack panel, as shown in the following markup: <StackPanel> <Button Name="GetEmployeesSyncButton" Click="GetEmployeesSyncButton_Click"> Get Employees Synchronously</Button> <Button Name="GetEmployeesAsyncButton" Click="GetEmployeesAsyncButton_Click"> Get Employees Asynchronously</Button> <TextBox HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" Text="Type in here" /> <ListBox Name="EmployeesListBox" Height="400" /> </StackPanel> Visual Studio 2022 has good support for building WPF apps and will provide Intel- liSense as you edit code and XAML markup. Visual Studio Code does not. 6. In MainWindow.xaml.cs, import namespaces to work with ADO.NET and the stopwatch, as shown in the following code: using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient; // To use SqlConnection and so on. using System.Diagnostics; // To use Stopwatch. 7. In the MainWindow class, in the constructor, define two string fields for the database connec- tion string and SQL statement, as shown in the following code: private string connectionString; private string sql = "WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05';" + "SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName FROM Employees"; The SQL has two statements. The first waits for five seconds to simulate a long-run- ning query. 8. In the MainWindow class, in the constructor, after the call to InitializeComponent, use an SqlConnectionStringBuilder to set the database connection string, as shown in the following code: public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent();
