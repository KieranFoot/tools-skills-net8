Packaging and Distributing .NET Types 384 There are two elements that you can use to specify runtime identifiers. Use <RuntimeIdentifier> if you only need to specify one. Use <RuntimeIdentifiers> if you need to specify multiple, as we did in the preceding example. If you use the wrong one, then the compiler will give an error and it can be difficult to understand why with only one character difference! Understanding dotnet commands When you install the .NET SDK, it includes a command-line interface (CLI) named dotnet. The .NET CLI has commands that work on the current folder to create a new project using templates: 1. On Windows, start Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. On macOS, start Terminal. If you prefer to use Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code, then you can use the integrated terminal. 2. Enter the dotnet new list (or dotnet new -l or dotnet new --list with older SDKs) command to list your currently installed templates, the most common of which are shown in Table 7.6: Template Name Short Name Language .NET MAUI App maui C# .NET MAUI Blazor App maui-blazor C# ASP.NET Core Empty web C#, F# ASP.NET Core gRPC Service grpc C# ASP.NET Core Web API webapi C#, F# ASP.NET Core Web API (native AOT) webapiaot C# ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View- mvc C#, F# Controller) Blazor Web App blazor C# Class Library classlib C#, F#, VB Console App console C#, F#, VB EditorConfig File editorconfig global.json File globaljson Solution File sln xUnit Test Project xunit Table 7.6: Project template full and short names .NET MAUI projects are not supported for Linux.
