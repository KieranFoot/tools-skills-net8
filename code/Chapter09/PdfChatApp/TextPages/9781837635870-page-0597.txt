Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 578 Exercise 10.3 – Working with transactions Add transactions to the modification code: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/ main/docs/ch10-transactions.md. Exercise 10.4 – Explore a Code First EF Core model Work through an example of a Code First model that generates an empty database, seeds it with sample data, and then queries the data: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ ch10-code-first.md. Exercise 10.5 – Explore app secrets When connecting to a database, you often need to include sensitive secret values like a username or password. These values should never be stored in source code or even in a separate file that might be added to a code repository. Secrets should be stored locally during development and in secure systems for production. You can use Secret Manager during local development and Azure Key Vault for cloud production systems. To learn more about app secrets, I have written an online-only section that you can read at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch10-app-secrets.md Exercise 10.6 – Explore topics Use the links on the following page to learn more details about the topics covered in this chapter: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/book-links.md#chapter-10--- working-with-data-using-entity-framework-core Exercise 10.7 – Explore NoSQL databases This chapter focused on RDBMSs such as SQL Server and SQLite. If you wish to learn more about NoSQL databases, such as Cosmos DB and MongoDB, and how to use them with EF Core, then I recommend the following links: • Welcome to Azure Cosmos DB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/ introduction • Use NoSQL databases as a persistence infrastructure: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/nosql- database-persistence-infrastructure • Document database providers for Entity Framework Core: https://github.com/ BlueshiftSoftware/EntityFrameworkCore
