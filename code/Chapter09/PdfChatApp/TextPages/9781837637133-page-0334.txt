Chapter 7 301 Figure 7.3: Common ways to convert between Noda Time date/time types Exploring Node Time in a console app Let’s write some code: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a new Console App / console project named WorkingWithNodaTime to the Chapter07 solution. • In the project file, treat warnings as errors, then statically and globally import the System.Console class, and add a package reference for NodaTime, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="NodaTime" Version="3.1.9" /> </ItemGroup> 2. Add a new class file named Program.Helpers.cs, and replace its contents, as shown in the following code: partial class Program { private static void SectionTitle(string title) { ConsoleColor previousColor = ForegroundColor; ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkYellow; WriteLine($"*** {title}"); ForegroundColor = previousColor; } }
