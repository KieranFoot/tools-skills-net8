Speaking C# 60 The adjective, black, comes before the noun, cat. Whereas French grammar has a different order; the adjective comes after the noun: “le chat noir.” What’s important to take away from this is that the order matters. C# indicates the end of a statement with a semicolon. A statement can be composed of multiple types, variables, and expressions made up of tokens. Each token is separated by white space or some other recognizably different token, like an operator, for example, = or +. For example, in the following statement, decimal is a type, totalPrice is a variable, and subtotal + is an expression: salesTax decimal totalPrice = subtotal + salesTax; The expression is made up of an operand named subtotal, an operator +, and another operand named salesTax. The order of operands and operators matters because the order affects the meaning and result. Comments Comments are the primary method of documenting your code to increase an understanding of how it works, for other developers to read, or for you to read even when you come back to it months later. In Chapter 4, Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions, you will learn about XML com- ments that start with three slashes, ///, and work with a tool to generate web pages to document your code. You can add comments to explain your code using a double slash, //. The compiler will ignore every- thing after the // until the end of the line, as shown in the following code: // Sales tax must be added to the subtotal. var totalPrice = subtotal + salesTax; To write a multiline comment, use /* at the beginning and */ at the end of the comment, as shown in the following code: /* This is a multi-line comment. */
