Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 516 Let’s take a minute to look at a diagram of the Northwind database. You can use the diagram in Figure 10.1 to refer to as we write code and queries throughout this book: Figure 10.1: The Northwind database tables and relationships You will write code to work with the Categories and Products tables later in this chapter, and other tables in later chapters. But before we do, note that: • Each category has a unique identifier, name, description, and picture. • Each product has a unique identifier, name, unit price, units in stock, and other fields. • Each product is associated with a category by storing the category’s unique identifier. Categories and Products is one-to-many, meaning each category • The relationship between can have zero or more products. This is indicated in Figure 10.1 by an infinity symbol at one end (meaning many) and a yellow key at the other end (meaning one). Using SQLite SQLite is a small, fast, cross-platform, self-contained RDBMS that is available in the public domain. It’s the most common RDBMS for mobile platforms such as iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world and there are more than one trillion SQLite databases in active use.
