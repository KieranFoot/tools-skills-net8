Chapter 1 41 Definitions can be either reverse-engineered from metadata or loaded from the original source code if that is enabled. Personally, I find the code from metadata more useful, as you are about to see. At the end of this section, try switching the Source Link option back on to see the difference. 2. In the HelloCS project, at the bottom of Program.cs, enter the following statement to declare an integer variable named z: int z; 3. Click on int, right-click on int, and then choose Go To Definition in Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code. In JetBrains Rider, choose Go to | Go to Declaration or Usages. int data type is defined, as shown in 4. In the code window that appears, you can see how the Figure 1.17: Figure 1.17: The int data type metadata You can see that int: • Is defined using the struct keyword. System.Runtime assembly. • Is in the System namespace. • Is in the Int32. • Is named System.Int32 type. • Is therefore an alias for the IComparable. • Implements interfaces such as • Has constant values for its maximum and minimum values. Parse. (Not visible in Figure 1.17.) • Has methods such as Right now, the Go To Definition feature is not that useful to you because you do not yet know what all of this information means. By the end of the first part of this book, which consists of Chapters 2 to 6 and teaches you about the C# language, you will know enough for this feature to become very handy.
