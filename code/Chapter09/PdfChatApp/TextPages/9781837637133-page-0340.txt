8 Building and Securing Web Services Using Minimal APIs This chapter is about building and securing web services using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs. This includes implementing techniques to protect a web service from attacks as well as authentication and authorization. This chapter will cover the following topics: • Building web services using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs • Relaxing the same origin security policy using CORS • Preventing denial of service attacks using rate limiting • Improving startup time and resources using native AOT • Understanding identity services Building web services using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs In older versions of ASP.NET Core, you would build a web service using controllers with an action method for each endpoint, a bit like building a website with ASP.NET Core MVC using controllers and models but without the views. Since .NET 6, you have another, often better, choice: ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs. Benefits of Minimal API-based web services In earlier versions of ASP.NET Core, implementing even a simple web service required a lot of boiler- plate code compared to alternative web development platforms. For example, a minimal Hello World web service implementation that has a single endpoint that returns plain text could be implemented using Express.js in just nine lines of code, as shown in the following code: const express = require('express') const app = express()
