Close the browser and shut down the web server. Output caching In some ways, output caching is like response caching, which we covered in Chapter 9, Caching, Queu- ing, and Resilient Background Services. Output caching can store dynamically generated responses on the server so that they do not have to be regenerated again for another request. This can improve performance. Unlike response caching, output caching does not rely on clients and intermediaries doing what they are told by the HTTP response headers.
