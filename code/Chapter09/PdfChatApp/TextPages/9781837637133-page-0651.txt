Building Efficient Microservices Using gRPC 618 4. In your code editor, in the HttpRequests folder, create a new file named grpc-json-transcoding. http, and add statements to make requests for employees using HTTP/1.1, as shown in the following code: ### Configure a variable for the gRPC service base address. @base_address = https://localhost:5131/ ### Get Nancy Davolio. GET {{base_address}}v1/employee/1 ### Get Andrew Fuller Davolio. GET {{base_address}}v1/employee/2 5. Send both requests, confirm the responses are correct, and then review the gRPC service command prompt or terminal to confirm that the requests were made using HTTP/1.1, as shown in the following output: info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[1] Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET https://localhost:5131/v1/employee/2 - - - info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware[0] Executing endpoint 'gRPC - /v1/employee/{employee_id}' info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware[1] Executed endpoint 'gRPC - /v1/employee/{employee_id}' info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[2] Request finished HTTP/1.1 GET https://localhost:5131/v1/employee/2 - 200 - application/json;+charset=utf-8 7.9328ms 6. Close the .http file, close the browser, and shut down the web server. Comparing with gRPC-Web gRPC-Web is an alternative to gRPC JSON transcoding to allow gRPC services to be called from a browser. gRPC-Web achieves this by executing a gRPC-Web client inside the browser. This has the advantage that the communications between the browser and gRPC service use Protobuf and therefore get all the performance and scalability benefits of true gRPC communication. As you have seen, gRPC JSON transcoding allows browsers to call gRPC services as if they were HTTP APIs with JSON. The browser needs to know nothing about gRPC. The gRPC service is responsible for converting those HTTP API calls into calls to the actual gRPC service implementation. To simplify and summarize: • gRPC JSON transcoding happens on the server side. • gRPC-Web happens on the client side.
