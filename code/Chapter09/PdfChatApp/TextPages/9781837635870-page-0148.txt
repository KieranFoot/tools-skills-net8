My random number is 4 Three or four One After end of switch After A_label // Second random run. My random number is 2 Two One After end of switch After A_label // Third random run. My random number is 6 Default After end of switch After A_label // Fourth random run. My random number is 1 One After end of switch After A_label // Fifth random run. My random number is 5 After A_label
