Chapter 1 29 Getting help for the dotnet tool At the command prompt, you can ask the dotnet tool for help with its commands. The syntax is: dotnet help <command> This will cause your web browser to open a page in the documentation about the specified command. Common dotnet commands include new, build, and run. Warning! The dotnet help new command worked with .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6, but it returns an error with .NET 7 or later: Specified command 'new' is not a valid SDK command. Specify a valid SDK command. For more information, run dotnet help. Hopefully, the .NET team will fix that bug soon! Another type of help is command-line documentation. It follows this syntax: dotnet <command> -?|-h|--help For example, dotnet new -? or dotnet new -h or dotnet new --help outputs documentation about the new command at the command prompt. As you should now expect, dotnet help help opens a web browser for the help command, and dotnet help -h outputs documentation for the help command at the command prompt! Letâ€™s try some examples: 1. To open the official documentation in a web browser window for the dotnet build command, enter the following at the command prompt or in the Visual Studio Code terminal, and note the page opened in your web browser, as shown in Figure 1.2: dotnet help build Figure 1.2: Web page documentation for the dotnet build command
