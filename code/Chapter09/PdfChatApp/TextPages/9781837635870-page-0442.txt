Run the code and view the result, as shown in the following output: There are 6 items in the array: Paris Tehran Chennai Sydney New York Medellín Later in this chapter, you will learn how to handle more complex string-splitting scenarios using a regular expression. Getting part of a string Sometimes, you need to get part of some text. The IndexOf method has nine overloads that return the index position of a specified char or string within a string. The Substring method has two overloads, as shown in the following list: • Substring(startIndex, length): Returns part of a string starting at startIndex and con- taining the next length characters Substring(startIndex): Returns part of a string starting at startIndex and containing all • characters up to the end of the string Let’s explore a simple example: 1. Add statements to store a person’s full name in a string variable with a space character be- tween the first and last names, find the position of the space, and then extract the first name and last name as two parts so that they can be recombined in a different order, as shown in the following code: string fullName = "Alan Shore"; int indexOfTheSpace = fullName.IndexOf(' '); string firstName = fullName.Substring( startIndex: 0, length: indexOfTheSpace); string lastName = fullName.Substring( startIndex: indexOfTheSpace + 1); WriteLine($"Original: {fullName}"); WriteLine($"Swapped: {lastName}, {firstName}");
