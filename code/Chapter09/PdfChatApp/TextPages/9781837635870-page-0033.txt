Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 14 End of support or end of life (EOL) means the date after which bug fixes, security updates, or technical assistance are no longer available from Microsoft. If you need long-term support from Microsoft, then choose .NET 8 today and stick with it even after .NET 9 releases in 2024. This is because .NET 9 will be an STS release, and it will therefore lose support in May 2026, before .NET 8 does in November 2026. As soon as .NET 10 is released, start upgrading your .NET 8 projects to it. You will have a year to do so before .NET 8 reaches its end of life. Good Practice: Remember that with all releases, you must upgrade to bug-fix releases like .NET runtime 8.0.1 and .NET SDK 8.0.101, which are expected to release in December 2023, because updates are released every month. At the time of publishing in November 2023, all versions of modern .NET have reached their end of life except those shown in the following list, which are ordered by their end-of-life dates: • .NET 7 will reach end-of-life on May 14, 2024. • .NET 6 will reach end-of-life on November 12, 2024. • .NET 8 will reach end-of-life on November 10, 2026. You can check which .NET versions are currently supported and when they will reach end- of-life at the following link: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases. md. Understanding .NET support phases The lifetime of a version of .NET passes through several phases, during which they have varying levels of support, as described in the following list: • Preview: Not supported. .NET 8 Preview 1 to Preview 7 were in this support phase from Feb- ruary 2023 to August 2023. • Go Live: Supported until GA, then becomes immediately unsupported so you must upgrade to the final release version as soon as it is available. .NET 8 Release Candidate 1 and Release Candidate 2 were in this support phase in September and October 2023. • Active: .NET 8 will be in this support phase from November 2023 to May 2026. • Maintenance: Supported only with security fixes for the last 6 months of its lifetime. .NET 8 will be in this support phase from May 2026 to November 2026. • End-of-life: Not supported. .NET 8 will reach its end of life in November 2026.
