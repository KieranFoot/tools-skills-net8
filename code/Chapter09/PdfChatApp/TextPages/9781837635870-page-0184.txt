Chapter 3 165 3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range? x = y++; and x = ++y;? 4. What is the difference between What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement? 5. 6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required? = and == operators? 7. What is the difference between the 8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; ; ) ; 9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression? What interface must an object “implement” to be enumerated over by using the foreach 10. statement? Exercise 3.2 – Explore loops and overflow What will happen if this code executes? int max = 500; for (byte i = 0; i < max; i++) { WriteLine(i); } Create a console app in Chapter03 named Ch03Ex02LoopsAndOverflow and enter the preceding code. Run the console app and view the output. What happens? What code could you add (don’t change any of the preceding code) to warn us about the problem? Exercise 3.3 – Test your knowledge of operators What are the values of x and y after the following statements execute? Create a console app in Chapter03 named Ch03Ex03Operators to test your assumptions: 1. Increment and addition operators: x = 3; y = 2 + ++x; 2. Binary shift operators: x = 3 << 2; y = 10 >> 1; 3. Bitwise operators: x = 10 & 8; y = 10 | 7;
