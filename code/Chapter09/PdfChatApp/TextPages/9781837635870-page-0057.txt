Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 38 You can check what versions a .NET feature supports by appending #applies-to to the end of a link, for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis. stringsyntaxattribute#applies-to We can therefore see that the StringSyntax attribute is only available in .NET 7 or later.

To open the official documentation in a web browser window for the dotnet build command, enter the following at the command prompt or in the Visual Studio Code terminal, and note the page opened in your web browser, as shown in Figure 1.15: dotnet help build
