Building Entity Models for SQL Server Using EF Core 90 Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" Version="8.0.0" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="8.0.0" /> </ItemGroup> <ItemGroup> <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" /> </ItemGroup> 3. Build the project to restore packages. The next step assumes a database connection string for a local SQL Server au- thenticated with Windows integrated security. Modify it for Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Edge with a user ID and password if necessary. 4. At a command prompt or terminal in the Northwind.Console.EFCore folder, generate a model for all the tables in a new folder named Models, as shown in the following command: dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --output-dir Models --namespace Northwind.Models --data-annotations --context NorthwindDb Command-line tools need to have their commands entered all in one line.

Then make sure that the whole command is properly formatted as a single line with correct spacing before you then copy and paste it to the command line. Copying and pasting directly from the eBook is likely to include newline characters, missing spaces, and so on that break the command. All command lines that must be entered from this book are available to copy from as a single line at the following link: https://github. com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/command-lines.md.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer. • The database provider: --output-dir Models. • The output folder:
