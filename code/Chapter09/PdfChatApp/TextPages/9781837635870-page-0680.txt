In the Network tab, click localhost, and note the response is Hello World! in plain text, from the cross-platform Kestrel web server, as shown in Figure 13.2: Figure 13.2: Plain text response from the website project Browsers like Chrome might also request a favicon.ico file to show in their browser window or tab, but this file does not exist in our project, so it shows as a 404 Not Found error. If this annoys you, then you can generate a favicon.ico file for free at the following link and put it in the project folder: https://favicon. io/. On a web page, you can also specify one in the meta tags, for example, a blank one using Base64 encoding, as shown in the following markup: <link rel="icon" href="data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo="> 9. Enter the address https://localhost:5131/ and note that if you are not using Visual Studio 2022 or if you clicked No when prompted to trust the SSL certificate, then the response is a privacy error. You will see this error when you have not configured a certificate that the browser can trust to encrypt and decrypt HTTPS traffic (if you do not see this error, it is because you have already configured a certificate). In a production environment, you would want to pay a company such as Verisign for an SSL certificate because they provide liability protection and technical support. During development, you can tell your OS to trust a temporary development certificate provided by ASP.NET Core. For Linux Developers: If you use a Linux variant that cannot create self-signed certificates or you do not mind reapplying for a new certificate every 90 days, then you can get a free certificate from the following link: https://letsencrypt.org.
