Controlling Flow, Converting Types, and Handling Exceptions 166 Exercise 3.4 – Practice loops and operators FizzBuzz is a group game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incre- mentally, replacing any number divisible by 3 with the word fizz, any number divisible by 5 with the word buzz, and any number divisible by both with fizzbuzz. Create a console app in Chapter03 named Ch03Ex04FizzBuzz that outputs a simulated FizzBuzz game that counts up to 100. The output should look something like Figure 3.5: Figure 3.5: A simulated FizzBuzz game output Exercise 3.5 – Practice exception handling Create a console app in Chapter03 named Ch03Ex05Exceptions that asks the user for two numbers in the range 0-255 and then divides the first number by the second: Enter a number between 0 and 255: 100 Enter another number between 0 and 255: 8 100 divided by 8 is 12 Write exception handlers to catch any thrown errors, as shown in the following output: Enter a number between 0 and 255: apples Enter another number between 0 and 255: bananas FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format.
