Chapter 7 403 Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite" /> </ItemGroup> </Project> To fix dependencies, every package should have a single version with no additional qualifiers. Addi- tional qualifiers include betas (beta1), release candidates (rc4), and wildcards (*). Wildcards allow future versions to be automatically referenced and used because they always represent the most recent release. But wildcards are, therefore, dangerous because they could result in the use of future incompatible packages that break your code. This can be worth the risk while writing a book where new preview versions are released every month and you do not want to keep updating the preview package references, as I did during 2023, and as shown in the following markup: <PackageReference Version="8.0.0-preview.*" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite" /> To also automatically use the release candidates that arrive in September and October each year, you can make the pattern even more flexible, as shown in the following markup: <PackageReference Version="8.0-*" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite" /> If you use the dotnet add package command or Visual Studio’s Manage NuGet Packages, then it will by default use the latest specific version of a package. But if you copy and paste configuration from a blog article or manually add a reference yourself, you might include wildcard qualifiers. The following dependencies are examples of NuGet package references that are not fixed and, there- fore, should be avoided unless you know the implications: <PackageReference Include="System.Net.Http" Version="4.1.0-*" /> <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.2-beta1" /> Good Practice: Microsoft guarantees that if you fix your dependencies to what ships with a specific version of .NET, for example, 8.0.0, those packages will all work together. Almost always fix your dependencies, especially in production deployments. Packaging a library for NuGet Now, let’s package the SharedLibrary project that you created earlier:
