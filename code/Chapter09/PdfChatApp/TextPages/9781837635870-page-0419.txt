Packaging and Distributing .NET Types 400 You can learn how to use the ILSpy extension for Visual Studio Code at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/code-editors/ vscode.md#decompiling-using-the-ilspy-extension-for-visual-studio-code. Viewing source links with Visual Studio 2022 Instead of decompiling, Visual Studio 2022 has a feature that allows you to view the original source code using source links. This feature is not available in Visual Studio Code. Let’s see how it works: 1. In Visual Studio 2022, enable Source Link: • Navigate to Tools | Options. navigation in source. • In the search box, enter • Select Text Editor | C# | Advanced. • Select the Enable navigation to Source Link and Embedded sources check box, and then click OK. In Visual Studio 2022, add a new Console App project to the Chapter07 solution named 2. SourceLinks. Program.cs, delete the existing statements. Add statements to declare a string variable 3. In and then output its value and the number of characters it has, as shown in the following code: string name = "Timothée Chalamet"; int length = name.Count(); Console.WriteLine($"{name} has {length} characters."); 4. Right-click in the Count() method and select Go To Implementation. Count.cs and it defines a partial Enumerable class with 5. Note the source code file is named implementations of five count-related methods, as shown in Figure 7.6: Figure 7.6: Viewing the original source file for LINQ’s Count method implementation
