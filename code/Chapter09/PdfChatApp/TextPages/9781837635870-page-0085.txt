Speaking C# 66 Similarly, Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code’s C# extension help you write C# code by high- lighting spelling mistakes, such as the method name needing to be WriteLine with an uppercase L, and grammatical errors, such as statements that must end with a semicolon. The C# extension constantly watches what you type and gives you feedback by highlighting problems with colored squiggly lines, like that of Microsoft Word. Let’s see it in action: 1. In Program.cs, change the L in the WriteLine method to lowercase. 2. Delete the semicolon at the end of the statement. 3. In Visual Studio Code, navigate to View | Problems; in Visual Studio 2022, navigate to View | Error List; or in JetBrains Rider, navigate to View | Tool Windows | Problems, and note that a red squiggle appears under the code mistakes and details are shown, as you can see in Figure 2.3: Figure 2.3: The Error List window showing two compile errors 4. Fix the two coding errors. Importing namespaces System is a namespace, which is like an address for a type. To refer to someone’s location exactly, you Oxford.HighStreet.BobSmith, which tells us to look for a person named Bob Smith on the might use High Street in the city of Oxford. System.Console.WriteLine tells the compiler to look for a method named WriteLine in a type named Console in a namespace named System.
