Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization 276 ToLocalTime(): 31/05/2022 16:17:03 ToUniversalTime(): 31/05/2022 15:17:03 *** DateTime.UtcNow Value: 31/05/2022 15:17:03 Kind: Utc IsDaylightSavingTime: False ToLocalTime(): 31/05/2022 16:17:03 ToUniversalTime(): 31/05/2022 15:17:03 *** TimeZoneInfo.Local Id: GMT Standard Time IsDaylightSavingTime(DateTime.Now): True StandardName: GMT Standard Time DaylightName: GMT Summer Time BaseUtcOffset: 00:00:00 *** TimeZoneInfo.Utc Id: UTC IsDaylightSavingTime(DateTime.Now): False StandardName: Coordinated Universal Time DaylightName: Coordinated Universal Time BaseUtcOffset: 00:00:00 The BaseUtcOffset of the GMT Standard Time zone is zero because normally Daylight Saving is not active. That is why it is prefixed with Base. 6. In Program.cs, add statements to prompt the user to enter a time zone (using Eastern Standard Time as a default), get that time zone, output details about it, and then compare a time entered by the user with the equivalent time in the other time zone, and catch potential exceptions, as shown in the following code: Write("Enter a time zone or press Enter for US East Coast: "); string zoneId = ReadLine()!; if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(zoneId)) { zoneId = "Eastern Standard Time"; } try { TimeZoneInfo otherZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(zoneId);
