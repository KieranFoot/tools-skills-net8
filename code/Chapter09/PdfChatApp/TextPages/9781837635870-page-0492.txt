In Program.cs, add statements to create an instance of FileInfo for the backup file, and write information about it to the console, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Getting file information"); FileInfo info = new(backupFile); WriteLine($"{backupFile}:"); WriteLine($" Contains {info.Length} bytes."); WriteLine($" Last accessed: {info.LastAccessTime}"); WriteLine($" Has readonly set to {info.IsReadOnly}."); 2. Run the code and view the result, as shown in the following output: C:\Users\markj\OneDrive\Documents\OutputFiles\Dummy.bak: Contains 12 bytes. Last accessed: 13/07/2023 12:11:12 Has readonly set to False. The number of bytes might be different on your operating system because operating systems can use different line endings.
