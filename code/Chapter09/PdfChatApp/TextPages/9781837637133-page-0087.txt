Managing Relational Data Using SQL Server 54 CREATE INDEX IX_FullName Change an aggregate index with multiple columns and control the sort order. ON Employees(LastName, FirstName DESC) WITH (DROP_EXISTING = ON) DROP TABLE Employees Delete the Employees table. If it does not exist, then this throws an error. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Employees Delete the Employees table if it already exists. This avoids the potential error from using the statement in the previous row. IF OBJECT_ID(N'Employees', N'U') Check if a table exists. The N prefix before a text literal means Unicode. 'U' means a user table as IS NOT NULL opposed to a system table. Table 2.5: Example DDL statements with descriptions Managing data with low-level APIs The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package provides database connectivity to SQL Server for .NET ap- plications. It is also known as the ADO.NET driver for SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. More Information: You can find the GitHub repository for ADO.NET at the following link: https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient. The Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package supports the following .NET platforms: • .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later. • .NET Core 3.1 and later. • .NET Standard 2.0 and later. Understanding the types in ADO.NET ADO.NET defines abstract types that represent minimal objects for working with data, like DbConnection, DbCommand, and DbDataReader. Database software manufacturers can inherit from and provide specific implementations that are optimized for and expose additional features for their database. Microsoft has done this for SQL Server. The most important types with their most used members are shown in Table 2.6: Type Properties Methods Description SqlConnection ConnectionString, Open, Close, Manage the connec- tion to the database.
