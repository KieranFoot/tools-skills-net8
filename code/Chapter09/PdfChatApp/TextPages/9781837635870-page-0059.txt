Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 40 Getting definitions of types and their members One of the most useful features of a code editor is Go To Definition (F12). It is available in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2022, and JetBrains Rider. It will show what the public definition of the type or member looks like by reading the metadata in the compiled assembly. Some tools, such as ILSpy .NET Decompiler, will even reverse-engineer from the metadata and IL code back into C# or another language for you. A similar and related feature is named Go To Implementation (Ctrl + F12). Instead of reading the metadata or decompiling, this will show the actual source code if that is embedded using the optional source link feature. Warning! Go To Definition should go to the decompiled metadata for a member or type. But if you have previously viewed the source link, then it goes to the source link. Go To Implementation should go to the source link implementation for a member or type. But if you have disabled the source link, then it goes to the decompiled metadata. Let’s see how to use the Go To Definition feature: 1. In your preferred code editor, open the solution/folder named Chapter01. If you are using Visual Studio 2022: • Navigate to Tools | Options. navigation to source. • In the search box, enter • Select Text Editor | C# | Advanced. • Clear the Enable navigation to Source Link and Embedded sources check box, and then click OK, as shown in Figure 1.16: Figure 1.16: Disabling Source Link for the Go To Definition feature
