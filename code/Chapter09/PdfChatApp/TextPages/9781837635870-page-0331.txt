Implementing Interfaces and Inheriting Classes 312 If the Shout delegate field already referenced one or more methods, by assigning another method, that method would replace all the others. With delegates that are used for events, we usually want to make sure that a programmer only ever uses either the += operator or the -= operator to assign and remove methods: 1. To enforce this, in Person.cs, add the event keyword to the delegate field declaration, as highlighted in the following code: public event EventHandler? Shout; 2. Build the PeopleApp project and note the compiler error message, as shown in the following output: Program.cs(41,13): error CS0079: The event 'Person.Shout' can only appear on the left hand side of += or -= This is (almost) all that the event keyword does! If you will never have more than one meth- od assigned to a delegate field, then technically you do not need “events,” but it is still good practice to indicate your meaning and that you expect a delegate field to be used as an event. 3. In Program.cs, modify the comment and the method assignment to use += instead of just =, as highlighted in the following code: // Assign the method to the Shout event delegate. harry.Shout += Harry_Shout; 4. Run the PeopleApp project and note that it has the same behavior as before. In Program.EventHandlers.cs, create a second event handler for Harry’s Shout event, as 5. shown in the following code: // Another method to handle the event received by the harry object. private static void Harry_Shout_2(object? sender, EventArgs e) { WriteLine("Stop it!"); } 6. In Program.cs, after the statement that assigns the Harry_Shout method to the Shout event, Shout event too, as shown highlighted add a statement to attach the new event handler to the in the following code: // Assign the method(s) to the Shout event delegate. harry.Shout += Harry_Shout; harry.Shout += Harry_Shout_2; 7. Run the PeopleApp project, view the result, and note that both event handlers execute when- ever an event is raised, which only happens once the anger level is three or more, as shown in the following output:
