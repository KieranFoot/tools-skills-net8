Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization 260 Date and time calculations Now, letâ€™s try performing simple calculations on date and time values: 1. In Program.cs, add statements to perform addition and subtraction with Christmas 2024, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Date and time calculations"); DateTime beforeXmas = xmas.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays(12)); DateTime afterXmas = xmas.AddDays(12); WriteLine($"12 days before Christmas: {beforeXmas:d}"); WriteLine($"12 days after Christmas: {afterXmas:d}"); TimeSpan untilXmas = xmas - DateTime.Now; WriteLine($"Now: {DateTime.Now}"); WriteLine($"There are {untilXmas.Days} days and {untilXmas.Hours } hours until Christmas {xmas.Year."); WriteLine("There are {untilXmas.TotalHours:N0} hours " + $"until Christmas {xmas.Year}."); 2. Run the code, and note the results, as shown in the following output: *** Date and time calculations 12 days before Christmas: 12/13/2024 12 days after Christmas: 1/6/2025 Now: 5/30/2023 1:57:01 PM There are 574 days and 10 hours until Christmas 2024. There are 13,786 hours until Christmas 2024. 3. Add statements to define the time on Christmas Day that your children (or dog or cat or iguana?) might wake up to open presents, and display it in various ways, as shown in the following code: DateTime kidsWakeUp = new( year: 2024, month: 12, day: 25, hour: 6, minute: 30, second: 0); WriteLine($"Kids wake up: {kidsWakeUp}"); WriteLine($"The kids woke me up at { kidsWakeUp.ToShortTimeString()}");
