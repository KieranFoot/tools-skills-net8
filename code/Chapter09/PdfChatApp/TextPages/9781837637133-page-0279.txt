Using Popular Third-Party Libraries 246 Letâ€™s start: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a new Class Library / classlib project named GeneratingPdf.Models to the Chapter06 solution. GeneratingPdf.Models project, delete the file named Class1.cs. 2. In the GeneratingPdf.Models project, add a new class file named Category.cs and modify 3. In the its contents to define a class with two properties for the name and identifier of a category, as shown in the following code: namespace GeneratingPdf.Models; public class Category { public int CategoryId { get; set; } public string CategoryName { get; set; } = null!; } Later, you will create an images folder with filenames that use the pattern categoryN.jpeg, where N is a number from 1 to 8 that matches the CategoryId values. 4. In the GeneratingPdf.Models project, add a new class file named Catalog.cs and modify its contents to define a class with a property to store the eight categories, as shown in the following code: namespace GeneratingPdf.Models; public class Catalog { public List<Category> Categories { get; set; } = null!; } 5. Use your preferred code editor to add a new Class Library / classlib project named GeneratingPdf.Document to the Chapter06 solution. GeneratingPdf.Document project, add a package reference for QuestPDF and a project 6. In the Models class library, as shown in the following markup: reference for the <ItemGroup> <!-- The newest version with an MIT license. --> <PackageReference Include="QuestPDF" Version="2022.12.6" /> </ItemGroup> <ItemGroup>
