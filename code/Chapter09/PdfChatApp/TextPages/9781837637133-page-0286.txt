7 Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization This chapter is about some of the common types that are included with .NET. These include types to manipulate dates and times and implement internationalization, which includes globalization and localization. When writing code to handle times, it is especially important to consider time zones. Bugs are often introduced because two times are compared in different time zones without taking that into account. It is important to understand the concept of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and to convert time values into UTC before performing time manipulation. You should also be aware of any Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments that might be needed. This chapter covers the following topics: • Working with dates and times • Working with time zones • Working with cultures • Working with Noda Time Working with dates and times After numbers and text, the next most popular types of data to work with are dates and times. The two main types are as follows: • DateTime: Represents a combined date and time value for a fixed point in time. TimeSpan: Represents a duration of time. • These two types are often used together. For example, if you subtract one DateTime value from anoth- er, the result is a TimeSpan. If you add a TimeSpan to a DateTime, then the result is a DateTime value.
