If it has, then delete or comment out that element, as shown in the following markup: <!-- An element like this will remove the file from the build process. <ItemGroup> <GraphQL Remove="seafoodProducts.graphql" /> </ItemGroup> --> Good Practice: There must be at least one .graphql file for the Strawberry Shake tool to be able to generate its code automatically.
