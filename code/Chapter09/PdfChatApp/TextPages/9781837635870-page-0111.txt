Speaking C# 92 • D: Compiler infers double • F: Compiler infers float A literal number with a decimal point is inferred as double unless you add the M suffix, in which case the compiler infers a decimal variable, or the F suffix, in which case it infers a float variable. Double quotes indicate a string variable, single quotes indicate a char variable, and the true and false values infer a bool type: 1. Modify the previous statements to use var, as shown in the following code: var population = 67_000_000; // 67 million in UK. var weight = 1.88; // in kilograms. var price = 4.99M; // in pounds sterling. var fruit = "Apples"; // string values use double-quotes. var letter = 'Z'; // char values use single-quotes. var happy = true; // Booleans can only be true or false. 2. Hover your mouse over each of the var keywords and note that your code editor shows a tooltip with information about the type that has been inferred. Program.cs, import the namespace for working with XML to enable us to declare 3. At the top of some variables using types in that namespace, as shown in the following code: using System.Xml; // To use XmlDocument. 4. At the bottom of Program.cs, add statements to create some new objects, as shown in the following code: // Good use of var because it avoids the repeated type // as shown in the more verbose second statement. var xml1 = new XmlDocument(); // Works with C# 3 and later. XmlDocument xml2 = new XmlDocument(); // Works with all C# versions. // Bad use of var because we cannot tell the type, so we // should use a specific type declaration as shown in // the second statement. var file1 = File.CreateText("something1.txt"); StreamWriter file2 = File.CreateText("something2.txt"); Good Practice: Although using var is convenient, some developers avoid using it to make it easier for a code reader to understand the types in use. Personally, I use it only when the type is obvious. For example, in the preceding code statements, the first statement is just as clear as the second in stating what the types of the xml variables are, but it is shorter. However, the third statement isn’t clear in showing the type of the file variable, so the fourth is better because it shows that the type is StreamWriter. If in doubt, spell it out!
