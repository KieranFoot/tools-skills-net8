Chapter 8 429 Note the following about the code: • The @ character switches off the ability to use escape characters in the string. Escape \t means a tab and \n means a characters are prefixed with a backslash. For example, new line. When writing regular expressions, we need to disable this feature. To para- phrase the television show The West Wing, “Let backslash be backslash.” @, then they can be interpreted by a regular • Once escape characters are disabled with expression. For example, \d means digit. You will learn about more regular expression symbols that are prefixed with a backslash later in this topic. 2. Run the code, enter a whole number such as 34 for the age, and view the result, as shown in the following output: Enter your age: 34 Thank you! 3. Run the code again, enter carrots, and view the result, as shown in the following output: Enter your age: carrots This is not a valid age: carrots 4. Run the code again, enter bob30smith, and view the result, as shown in the following output: Enter your age: bob30smith Thank you! The regular expression we used is \d, which means one digit. However, it does not specify what can be entered before and after that one digit. This regular expression could be described in English as “Enter any characters you want as long as you enter at least one digit character.” In regular expressions, you indicate the start of some input with the caret ^ symbol and the $ symbol. Let’s use these symbols to indicate that we expect end of some input with the dollar nothing else between the start and end of the input except for a digit. 5. Add a ^ and a $ to change the regular expression to ^\d$, as shown highlighted in the following code: Regex ageChecker = new(@"^\d$"); 6. Run the code again and note that it rejects any input except a single digit. + after the \d expression to modify the meaning to one or more digits, as shown high- 7. Add a lighted in the following code: Regex ageChecker = new(@"^\d+$"); 8. Run the code again and note the regular expression only allows zero or positive whole num- bers of any length.
