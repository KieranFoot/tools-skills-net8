11 Querying and Manipulating Data Using LINQ This chapter is about Language INtegrated Query (LINQ) expressions. LINQ is a set of language ex- tensions that add the ability to work with sequences of data and then filter, sort, and project them into different outputs. This chapter will cover the following topics: • Writing LINQ expressions • LINQ in practice • Sorting and more • Using LINQ with EF Core • Joining, grouping, and lookups • Aggregating and paging sequences Writing LINQ expressions The first question we need to answer is a fundamental one: why does LINQ exist? Comparing imperative and declarative language features LINQ was introduced in 2008 with C# 3 and .NET Framework 3. Before that, if a C# and .NET pro- grammer wanted to process a sequence of items, they had to use procedural, aka imperative, code statements. For example, a loop: 1. Set the current position to the first item. Check if the item is one that should be processed by comparing one or more properties against 2. specified values. For example, is the unit price greater than 50, or is the country equal to Belgium?
