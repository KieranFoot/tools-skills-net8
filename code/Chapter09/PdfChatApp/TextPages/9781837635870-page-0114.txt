Chapter 2 95 Exploring more about console apps We have already created and used basic console apps, but we’re now at a stage where we should delve into them more deeply. Console apps are text-based and are run at the command prompt. They typically perform simple tasks that need to be scripted, such as compiling a file or encrypting a section of a configuration file. Equally, they can also have arguments passed to them to control their behavior. An example of this would be to create a new console app using the F# language with a specified name instead of using the name of the current folder, as shown in the following command: dotnet new console -lang "F#" --name "ExploringConsole" Displaying output to the user The two most common tasks that a console app performs are writing and reading data. We have already used the WriteLine method to output, but if we didn’t want a carriage return at the end of a line, for example, if we later wanted to continue to write more text at the end of that line, we could have used the Write method. If you want to write three letters to the console without carriage returns after them, then call the Write method, as shown in the following code: Write("A"); Write("B"); Write("C"); This would write the three characters on a single line and leave the cursor at the end of the line, as shown in the following output: ABC If you want to write three letters to the console with carriage returns after them, then call the WriteLine method, as shown in the following code: WriteLine("A"); WriteLine("B"); WriteLine("C"); This would write three lines and leave the cursor on the fourth line: A B C
