Querying and Manipulating Data Using LINQ 588 4. In FilteringUsingWhere, attempt to call the Where extension method on the array of names, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Filtering entities using Where"); var query = names.W 5. As you type the W, note that in older code editors (or code editors with the option to show items from unimported namespaces disabled) the Where method is missing from the IntelliSense list of members of a string array, as shown in Figure 11.1: Figure 11.1: IntelliSense with the Where extension method missing This is because Where is an extension method. It does not exist on the array type. To make the Where extension method available, we must import the System.Linq namespace. This is implicitly imported by default in new .NET 6 and later proj- ects, but we removed it to illustrate the point. Recent versions of code editors are smart enough to suggest using the Where method anyway and indicate that they will import the System.Linq namespace for you automatically. 6. If you are using Visual Studio 2022, navigate to Tools | Options. In the Options dialog box, nav- igate to Text Editor | C# | IntelliSense, select the Show items from unimported namespaces check box, and then click OK. In the project file, comment out the element that removed System.Linq, as shown in the 7. following code: <!--<Using Remove="System.Linq" />--> 8. Save the change and build the project. Retype the W for the Where method and note that the IntelliSense list now includes the extension 9. methods added by the Enumerable class, as shown in Figure 11.2:
