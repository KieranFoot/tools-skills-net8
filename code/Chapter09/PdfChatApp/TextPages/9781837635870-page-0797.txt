Building User Interfaces Using Blazor 778 For example: 1. In the Northwind.Blazor project, in INorthwindService.cs, add the following code: List<string?> GetCountries(); 2. In NorthwindServiceServerSide.cs, add the following code: public List<string?> GetCountries() { return _db.Customers.Select(c => c.Country) .Distinct().OrderBy(country => country).ToList(); } 3. In NavMenu.razor, add the following markup: @inject INorthwindService _service ... @foreach(string? country in _service.GetCountries()) { string countryLink = "customers/" + country; <div class="nav-item px-3"> <NavLink class="nav-link" href="@countryLink"> <span class="oi oi-people" aria-hidden="true"></span> Customers in @country </NavLink> </div> } You cannot use <NavLink class="nav-link" href="customers/@c"> because Blazor does not allow combined text and @ Razor expressions in components. That is why the code above creates a local variable to do the combining to make the country URL.
