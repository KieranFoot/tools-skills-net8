Chapter 4 175 2. In WritingFunctions.csproj, after the <PropertyGroup> section, add a new <ItemGroup> section to statically import System.Console for all C# files using the implicit usings .NET SDK feature, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" /> </ItemGroup> 3. Add a new class file to the project named Program.Functions.cs. In Program.Functions.cs, replace any existing code with new statements to define a function 4. named TimesTable in the partial Program class, as shown in the following code: partial class Program { static void TimesTable(byte number, byte size = 12) { WriteLine($"This is the {number} times table with {size} rows:"); WriteLine(); for (int row = 1; row <= size; row++) { WriteLine($"{row} x {number} = {row * number}"); } WriteLine(); } } In the preceding code, note the following: • TimesTable must have a byte value passed to it as a parameter named number. TimesTable can optionally have a byte value passed to it as a parameter named size. • 12. If a value is not passed, it defaults to TimesTable is a static method because it will be called by the static method <Main>$. • • TimesTable does not return a value to the caller, so it is declared with the void keyword before its name. TimesTable uses a for statement to output the times table for the number passed to it • with its number of rows equal to size. 5. In Program.cs, delete the existing statements and then call the function. Pass in a byte value number parameter, for example, 7, as shown in the following code: for the TimesTable(7);
