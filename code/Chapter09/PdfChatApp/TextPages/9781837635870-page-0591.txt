Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 572 Executing DbCommand [Parameters=[@p1='78', @p0='520' (Nullable = true)], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30'] UPDATE "Products" SET "UnitPrice" = @p0 WHERE "ProductId" = @p1; SELECT changes(); Increase price success for ID: 78. | Id | Product Name | Cost | Stock | Disc. | | 001 | Chai | $18.00 | 39 | False | ... | 078 | Bob's Burgers | $520.00 | 72 | False | Deleting entities You can remove individual entities with the Remove method. RemoveRange is more efficient when you want to delete multiple entities. Letâ€™s see how to delete rows from a table: 1. In Program.Modifications.cs, add a method to delete all products with a name that begins with a specified value (Bob in our example), as shown in the following code: private static int DeleteProducts(string productNameStartsWith) { using NorthwindDb db = new(); IQueryable<Product>? products = db.Products?.Where( p => p.ProductName.StartsWith(productNameStartsWith)); if (products is null || !products.Any()) { WriteLine("No products found to delete."); return 0; } else { if (db.Products is null) return 0; db.Products.RemoveRange(products); } int affected = db.SaveChanges(); return affected; }
