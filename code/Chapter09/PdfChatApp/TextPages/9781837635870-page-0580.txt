Chapter 10 561 3. In the foreach loop, before the WriteLine method call, add statements to check if explicit loading is enabled, and if so, prompt the user as to whether they want to explicitly load each individual category, as shown in the following code: if (explicitLoading) { Write($"Explicitly load products for {c.CategoryName}? (Y/N): "); ConsoleKeyInfo key = ReadKey(); WriteLine(); if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.Y) { CollectionEntry<Category, Product> products = db.Entry(c).Collection(c2 => c2.Products); if (!products.IsLoaded) products.Load(); } } 4. Run the code: • Press N to disable eager loading. • Then, press Y to enable explicit loading. • For each category, press Y or N to load its products as you wish. I chose to load products for only two of the eight categories, Beverages and Seafood, as shown in the following output, which has been edited for space: Enable eager loading? (Y/N): n Enable explicit loading?
