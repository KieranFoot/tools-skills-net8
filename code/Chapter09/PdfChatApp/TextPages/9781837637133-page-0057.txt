Introducing Apps and Services with .NET 24 Let’s explore how the top-level program feature works when you define functions: 1. Use your preferred coding tool to create a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Console App / console • Project file and folder: TopLevelFunctions • Solution file and folder: Chapter01 • Do not use top-level statements: Cleared • Enable native AOT publishing: Cleared Program.cs, delete the existing statements, define a local function at the bottom of the file, 2. In and call it, as shown in the following code: using static System.Console; WriteLine("Top-level functions example"); WhatsMyNamespace(); // Call the function. void WhatsMyNamespace() // Define a local function. { WriteLine("Namespace of Program class: {0}", arg0: typeof(Program).Namespace ?? "null"); } 3. Run the console app and note that the namespace for the Program class is null, as shown in the following output: Top-level functions example Namespace of Program class: null What is automatically generated for a local function? The compiler automatically generates a Program class with a <Main>$ function, then moves your statements and function inside the <Main>$ method, and renames the local function, as shown high- lighted in the following code: using static System.Console; partial class Program { static void <Main>$(String[] args) { WriteLine("Top-level functions example"); <<Main>$>g__WhatsMyNamespace|0_0(); // Call the function.
