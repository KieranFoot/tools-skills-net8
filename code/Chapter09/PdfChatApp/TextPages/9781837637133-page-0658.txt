Chapter 14 625 Figure 14.1: The ASP.NET Core MVC project template website home page Understanding visitor registration By default, passwords must have at least one non-alphanumeric character, at least one digit (0-9), and at least one uppercase letter (A-Z). I use Pa$$w0rd in scenarios like this when I am just exploring. The MVC project template follows best practices for double-opt-in (DOI), meaning that after filling in an email address and password to register, an email is sent to the email address, and the visitor must click a link in that email to confirm that they want to register. We have not yet configured an email provider to send that email, so we must simulate that step: 1. Close the Developer Tools pane. 2. In the top navigation menu, click Register. test@example.com 3. Enter an email and password, and then click the Register button. (I used and Pa$$w0rd.) Click the link with the text Click here to confirm your account and note that you are redirected 4. to a Confirm email web page that you could customize. 5. In the top navigation menu, click Login, enter your email address and password (note that there is an optional checkbox to remember you, and there are links if the visitor has forgot- ten their password or they want to register as a new visitor), and then click the Log in button. 6. Click your email address in the top navigation menu. This will navigate to an account manage- ment page. Note that you can set a phone number, change your email address, change your password, enable two-factor authentication (if you add an authenticator app), and download and delete your personal data. This last feature is good for compliance with legal regulations like the European GDPR. 7. Close Chrome, and then at the command prompt or terminal for the MVC website, press Ctrl + C to cleanly shut down the web server.
