You can see the full list of supported triggers and bindings at the following link: https:// learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers- bindings?tabs=csharp#supported-bindings. Triggers and bindings are configured differently for different languages. For C# and Java, you dec- orate methods and parameters with attributes. For the other languages, you configure a file named function.json. NCRONTAB expressions The Timer trigger uses NCRONTAB expressions to define the frequency of the timer. The default time zone is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This can be overridden but you really should use UTC for the reasons you learned about in Chapter 7, Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization. If you are hosting in an App Service plan, then you can alternatively use a TimeSpan, but I recommend learning NCRONTAB expressions for flexibility. An NCRONTAB expression consists of five or six parts (if seconds are included): * * * * * * - - - - - - | | | | | | | | | | | +--- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0) | | | | +----- month (1 - 12) | | | +------- day of month (1 - 31) | | +--------- hour (0 - 23) | +----------- min (0 - 59) +------------- sec (0 - 59) A star * in the value field above means all legal values, as in parentheses for that column. You can /. Here are some examples of how values can specify ranges using a hyphen, and a step value using be specified in this format: • 0 means at that value. For example, for hours, at midnight. 0,6,12,18 means at those listed values. For example, for hours, at midnight, 6 a.m., 12 noon, • and 6 p.m. 3-7 means at that inclusive range of values. For example, for hours, at 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 5 a.m., • 6 a.m., and 7 a.m. 4/3 means a start value of 4 and a step value of 3. For example, for hours, at 4 a.m., 7 a.m., 10 • a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m., and 10 p.m.
