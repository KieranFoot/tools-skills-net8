Epilogue 782 I strongly recommend that you review all the guidelines and apply them to your code. Companion books to continue your learning journey Soon, I will have written two more books to continue your learning journey with .NET 8 that you started with this fundamentals book. The two other books act as companions to this book, and together they all form a .NET 8 trilogy. 1. The first book (the one youâ€™re reading now) covers the fundamentals of C#, .NET, and ASP.NET Core for web development. The second book covers more specialized topics, like internationalization and popular third-par- 2. ty packages including Serilog and Noda Time. You will learn how to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and how to improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background services. You will implement more services using GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and Azure Functions. Finally, you will learn how to build graphical user interfaces for websites and desktop and mobile apps with Blazor and .NET MAUI. 3. The third book covers important tools and skills you should learn to become a well-rounded professional .NET developer. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debug- ging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing, from unit to performance and web and mobile, and then hosting and deployment topics like Docker and Azure Pipelines. Finally, we will look at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want. A summary of the .NET 8 trilogy and their most important topics is shown in Figure 17.1: Figure 17.1: Companion books for learning C# and .NET
