Table 7.2: Custom format code for date and time values More Information: A full list of custom format code can be found at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date- and-time-format-strings You can apply standard date and time formatting using simpler format code, like the d and D we used in the code example, as shown in Table 7.3: Format code Description Short date pattern. Varies by culture; for example, en-US uses M/d/yyyy and fr-FR d uses dd/MM/yyyy. Long date pattern. Varies by culture; for example, en-US uses mmmm, MMMM d, yyyy D and fr-FR uses mmmm, dd MMMM yyyy. f Full date/time pattern (short time – hours and minutes). Varies by culture. Full date/time pattern (long time – hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM). Varies by F culture. A standardized pattern, suitable to serialize date/time values for roundtrips, for o, O example, 2023-05-30T13:45:30.0000000-08:00. r, R RFC1123 pattern. Short time pattern. Varies by culture; for example, en-US uses h:mm tt and fr-FR t uses HH:mm. Long time pattern. Varies by culture; for example, en-US uses h:mm:ss tt and fr-FR T uses HH:mm:ss. u Universal sortable date/time pattern, for example, 2009-06-15 13:45:30Z. Universal full date/time pattern. Varies by culture; for example, en-US might be U Monday, June 15, 2009 8:45:30 PM. Table 7.3: Standard format code for date and time values
