Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization 286 7. Run the code again, and try Persian in Iran (fa-IR). Note that dates in Iran must be specified as year/month/day, and that this year (2023) is the year 1401 in the Persian calendar, as shown in the following output: The current globalization culture is fa-IR: فارسی (ایران) The current localization culture is fa-IR: فارسی (ایران) Days of the week: یکشنبه, دوشنبه, سه‌شنبه, چهارشنبه, پنجشنبه, جمعه, شنبه Months of the year: فروردین, اردیبهشت, خرداد, تیر, مرداد, شهریور, مهر, آبان, آذر, دی, بهمن, اسفند 1st day of this year: 1401 دی 11, شنبه Number group separator: ٬ Number decimal separator: ٫ Currency symbol: ریال Currency name: ریال ایران (Iranian Rial) IsMetric: True Enter your name: Cyrus Enter your date of birth: 1372/4/16 Enter your salary: 50000 Cyrus was born on a چهارشنبه.

Although I tried to confirm with a Persian reader whether this example is correct, due to factors like right-to-left languages being tricky to work with in console apps and copying and pasting from a console window into a word processor, I apologize in advance to my Persian readers if this example is all messed up! Temporarily using the invariant culture Sometimes, you might need to temporarily use a different culture without switching the current thread to that culture. For example, when automatically generating documents, queries, and commands that include data values, you might need to ignore your current culture and use a more standardized culture. For this purpose, you can use the invariant culture, which is based on US English. For example, you might need to generate a JSON document with a decimal number value and format the number with two decimal places, as shown in the following code: decimal price = 54321.99M; string document = $$""" { "price": "{{price:N2}}" } """;
