Building Mobile and Desktop Apps Using .NET MAUI 728 if (operationChars.Contains(button.Text)) { Output.Text = string.Empty; } else { Output.Text += button.Text; } } This is not a proper implementation for a calculator because the operations have not been implemented. It just simulates one for now because we are focusing on how to build UIs with .NET MAUI. You can Google how to implement a simple calculator as an optional exercise. 5. Start the Northwind.Maui.Client project with at least one desktop and one mobile device. Navigate to Employees, click some of the buttons, and note that the label updates to show what 6. is clicked, as shown on an emulated Android device in Figure 16.10: Figure 16.10: A simulated calculator on an emulated Android 7. Close the app. By now, we have built a few simple UIs using XAML and MAUI. Next, letâ€™s see some techniques to improve apps, like defining and sharing resources. Using shared resources When building graphical UIs, you will often want to use a resource, such as a brush to paint the back- ground of controls or an instance of a class to perform custom conversions. Resources can be defined at the following levels and shared with everything at that level or lower:
