3 Building Entity Models for SQL Server Using EF Core This chapter is about managing relational data stored in SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Edge by using the higher-level object-to-data store mapping technology named Entity Framework Core (EF Core). Then, you will learn how to store entity models that use inheritance hierarchies using three different mapping strategies. Finally, you will build class libraries for a SQL Server database that will be used in code examples throughout the rest of this book. This chapter will cover the following topics: • Managing SQL Server data with EF Core • Mapping inheritance hierarchies with EF Core • Building a reusable entity data model Managing data with EF Core EF Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that uses ADO.NET underneath when working with SQL Server. Because it is a higher-level technology, it is not as efficient as using ADO.NET directly, but it can be easier for developers to work with because they can treat the data as objects instead of rows in multiple tables. This should feel more natural for an object-oriented developer. EF Core 8 only targets .NET 8. EF Core 7 targeted .NET 6, so it could be used with both the Long Term Support (LTS) release of .NET 6 and the Standard Term Support (STS) release of.NET 7, as shown in Figure 3.1:
