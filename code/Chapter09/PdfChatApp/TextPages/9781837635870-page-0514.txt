Chapter 9 495 { new(initialSalary: 0M) { FirstName = "Sally", LastName = "Cox", DateOfBirth = new(year: 2012, month: 7, day: 12) } } } }; SectionTitle("Serializing as XML"); // Create serializer to format a "List of Person" as XML. XmlSerializer xs = new(type: people.GetType()); // Create a file to write to. string path = Combine(CurrentDirectory, "people.xml"); using (FileStream stream = File.Create(path)) { // Serialize the object graph to the stream. xs.Serialize(stream, people); } // Closes the stream. OutputFileInfo(path); 8. Run the code, view the result, and note that an exception is thrown, as shown in the following output: Unhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Packt.Shared. Person cannot be serialized because it does not have a parameterless constructor. 9. In Person.cs, add a statement to define a parameterless constructor, as shown in the following code: // A parameterless constructor is required for XML serialization. public Person() { } The constructor does not need to do anything, but it must exist so that the XmlSerializer can call it to instantiate new Person instances during the dese- rialization process.
