Managing Relational Data Using SQL Server 38 As described in the list above, when you write code to connect to a SQL Server database, you need to know its server name. The server name depends on the edition and version of SQL Server that you will connect to, as shown in Table 2.1: SQL Server edition Server name \ Instance name (localdb)\v11.0 LocalDB 2012 (localdb)\mssqllocaldb LocalDB 2016 or later .\sqlexpress Express Full/Developer (default . instance) .\apps-services-book Full/Developer (named instance) tcp:127.0.0.1,1433 Azure SQL Edge (local Docker) tcp:[custom server name].database.windows.net,1433 Azure SQL Database Table 2.1: Server name examples for various editions of SQL Server Good Practice: Use a dot (.) as shorthand for the local computer name (localhost).

Installing and setting up SQL Server locally Microsoft offers various editions of its popular and capable SQL Server product for Windows, Linux, and Docker containers. If you have Windows, then you can use a free version that runs standalone, known as SQL Server Developer Edition. You can also use the Express edition or the free SQL Server LocalDB edition that can be installed with Visual Studio 2022 for Windows. If you do not have a Windows computer or if you want to use a cross-platform database system, then you can skip ahead to the topic Setting up Azure SQL Database, or the online-only section Installing Azure SQL Edge in Docker found at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch02-sql-edge.md If you prefer to install SQL Server locally on Linux, then you will find instructions at the following https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup. link: Installing SQL Server Developer Edition for Windows On Windows, if you want to use the full edition of SQL Server instead of the simplified LocalDB or Ex- press editions, then you can find all SQL Server editions at the following link: https://www.microsoft. com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads.
