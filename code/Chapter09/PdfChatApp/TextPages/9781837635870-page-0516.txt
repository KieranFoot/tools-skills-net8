Chapter 9 497 1. At the top of Person.cs, import the System.Xml.Serialization namespace so that you can decorate some properties with the [XmlAttribute] attribute, as shown in the following code: using System.Xml.Serialization; // To use [XmlAttribute]. 2. In Person.cs, decorate the first name, last name, and date of birth properties with the [XmlAttribute] attribute, and set a short name for each property, as highlighted in the fol- lowing code: [XmlAttribute("fname")] public string? FirstName { get; set; } [XmlAttribute("lname")] public string? LastName { get; set; } [XmlAttribute("dob")] public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; } 3. Run the code, and note that the size of the file has reduced from 793 to 488 bytes, a space-sav- ing of more than a third. This reduction was achieved by outputting property values as XML attributes, as shown in the following output: **** File Info **** File: people.xml Path: C:\cs12dotnet8\Chapter09\WorkingWithSerialization\bin\Debug\net8.0 Size: 488 bytes. /------------------ <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <ArrayOfPerson xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"> <Person fname="Alice" lname="Smith" dob="1974-03-14T00:00:00" /> <Person fname="Bob" lname="Jones" dob="1969-11-23T00:00:00" /> <Person fname="Charlie" lname="Cox" dob="1984-05-04T00:00:00"> <Children> <Person fname="Sally" lname="Cox" dob="2012-07-12T00:00:00" /> </Children> </Person> </ArrayOfPerson> ------------------/
