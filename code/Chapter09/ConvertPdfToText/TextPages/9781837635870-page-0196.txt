Chapter 4 177 A parameter is a variable in a function definition. For example, startDate is a parameter of the Hire function, as shown in the following code: void Hire(DateTime startDate) { // Function implementation. } When a method is called, an argument is the data you pass into the methodâ€™s parameters. For example, when is a variable passed as an argument to the Hire function, as shown in the following code: DateTime when = new(year: 2024, month: 11, day: 5); Hire(when); You might prefer to specify the parameter name when passing the argument, as shown in the follow- ing code: DateTime when = new(year: 2024, month: 11, day: 5); Hire(startDate: when); When talking about the call to the Hire function, startDate is the parameter, and when is the argument. If you read the official Microsoft documentation, they use the phrases named and optional arguments and named and optional parameters interchangeably, as shown at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/ classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments. It gets complicated because a single object can act as both a parameter and an argument, depending Hire function implementation, the startDate parameter could on context. For example, within the be passed as an argument to another function like SaveToDatabase, as shown in the following code: void Hire(DateTime startDate) { ... SaveToDatabase(startDate, employeeRecord); ... } Naming things is one of the hardest parts of computing. A classic example is the parameter to the most important function in C#, Main. It defines a parameter named args, short for arguments, as shown in the following code: static void Main(String[] args) { ... }
