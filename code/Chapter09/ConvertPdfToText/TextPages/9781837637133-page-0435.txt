Setting up RabbitMQ using Docker The Docker image we will use has RabbitMQ version 3.12.0 and is designed to be used as a throwaway container, where you simply start the container and your project can start using it with the default configuration. More Information: You can read more about the Docker image at the following link: https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/. Letâ€™s get started with RabbitMQ in a Docker container: 1. Install Docker from the following link: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/. 2. Start Docker. 3. At the command prompt or terminal, pull down the latest container image for RabbitMQ on 5672 and 15672 to the container, which are used by default Docker and run it, opening ports by AMQP, as shown in the following command: docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.12-management 4. Note that the first time you run this command, the RabbitMQ image will not be found on your local computer, as shown in the following output: Unable to find image 'rabbitmq:3.12-management' locally 5. Note that the image will then be downloaded automatically, as shown in the following output: 3.12-management: Pulling from library/rabbitmq 99803d4b97f3: Pull complete 8fb904ec525a: Pull complete ba4d114a87c0: Pull complete c869b027f1e1: Pull complete 729c8b3166a8: Pull complete 7de098b90abf: Pull complete 4f206ad5199f: Pull complete
