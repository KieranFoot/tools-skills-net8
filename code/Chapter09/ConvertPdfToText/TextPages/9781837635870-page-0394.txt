Chapter 7 375 float System.Single double System.Double decimal System.Decimal bool System.Boolean object System.Object dynamic System.Dynamic.DynamicObject Table 7.3: C# type keywords and their actual .NET types Other .NET programming language compilers can do the same thing. For example, the Visual Basic .NET language has a type named Integer, which is its alias for System.Int32. Understanding native-sized integers C# 9 introduced the nint and nuint keyword aliases for native-sized integers, meaning that the stor- age size for the integer value is platform-specific. They store a 32-bit integer in a 32-bit process and sizeof() returns 4 bytes; they store a 64-bit integer in a 64-bit process and sizeof() returns 8 bytes. The aliases represent pointers to the integer value in memory, which is why their .NET names are IntPtr and UIntPtr. The actual storage type will be either System.Int32 or System.Int64, depending on the process. In a 64-bit process, the following code: WriteLine($"Environment.Is64BitProcess = {Environment.Is64BitProcess}"); WriteLine($"int.MaxValue = {int.MaxValue:N0}"); WriteLine($"nint.MaxValue = {nint.MaxValue:N0}"); produces this output: Environment.Is64BitProcess = True int.MaxValue = 2,147,483,647 nint.MaxValue = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Revealing the location of a type Code editors provide built-in documentation for .NET types. Let’s start by making sure that you have the expected experience and then explore: 1. If you are using Visual Studio 2022, then make sure you have disabled Source Link: • Navigate to Tools | Options. navigation in source. • In the search box, enter • Select Text Editor | C# | Advanced. Clear the Enable navigation to Source Link and Embedded sources checkbox, and • then click OK. 2. Right-click inside XDocument and choose Go to Definition.
