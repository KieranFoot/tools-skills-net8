Broadcasting Real-Time Communication Using SignalR 476 In late 1999, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 5 with a component named XMLHttpRequest that could make asynchronous HTTP calls in the background. This, alongside dynamic HTML (DHTML), allowed parts of the web page to be updated with fresh data smoothly. The benefits of this technique were obvious, and soon, all browsers added the same component. AJAX Google took maximum advantage of this capability to build clever web applications such as Google Maps and Gmail. A few years later, the technique became popularly known as Asynchronous JavaS- cript and XML (AJAX). AJAX still uses HTTP to communicate, however, and that has limitations: • First, HTTP is a request-response communication protocol, meaning that the server cannot push data to the client. It must wait for the client to make a request. • Second, HTTP request and response messages have headers with lots of potentially unneces- sary overhead. WebSocket WebSocket is full-duplex, meaning that either the client or server can initiate communicating new data. WebSocket uses the same TCP connection for the life cycle of the connection. It is also more efficient in the message sizes that it sends because they are minimally framed with 2 bytes. WebSocket works over HTTP ports 80 and 443 so it is compatible with the HTTP protocol, and the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to switch from the HTTP protocol to the Web- Socket protocol. Modern web apps are expected to deliver up-to-date information. Live chat is the canonical example, but there are lots of potential applications, from stock prices to games. Whenever you need the server to push updates to the web page, you need a web-compatible, real-time communication technology. WebSocket could be used, but it is not supported by all clients. You can check which clients support WebSocket using the web page found at the following link: https:// caniuse.com/websockets. WebSocket or WebSockets? “The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011. The current API specification allowing web applications to use this protocol is known as WebSockets.” From the Wikipedia page found at the following link: https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket. Introducing SignalR ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps by being an abstraction over multiple underlying communication technologies, which allows you to add real-time communication capabilities using C# code.
