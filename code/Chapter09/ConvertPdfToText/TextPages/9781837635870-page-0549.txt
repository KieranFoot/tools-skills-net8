Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 530 The project reference path and filename must all go on one line. 6. Build the WorkingWithEFCore project. Defining the Category and Product entity classes The Category class, also known as an entity model, will be used to represent a row in the Categories Northwind4SQLite. table. This table has four columns, as shown in the following DDL taken from the script file: sql CREATE TABLE Categories ( CategoryId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CategoryName NVARCHAR (15) NOT NULL, Description "NTEXT", Picture "IMAGE" ); We will use conventions to define: • Three of the four properties (we will not map the Picture column). • The primary key. Products table. • The one-to-many relationship to the To map the Description column to the correct database type, we will need to decorate the string property with the Column attribute. Later in this chapter, we will use the Fluent API to define that CategoryName cannot be null and is limited to a maximum of 15 characters. Let’s go: 1. In the Northwind.EntityModels project, modify the Category entity model class, as shown highlighted in the following code: using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; // To use [Column]. namespace Northwind.EntityModels; public class Category { // These properties map to columns in the database. public int CategoryId { get; set; } // The primary key.
