Chapter 5 247 5. Run the PeopleApp project and view the result, as shown in the following output: Bob Smith's favorite wonder is StatueOfZeusAtOlympia. Its integer is 2. The enum value is internally stored as an int for efficiency. The int values are automatically assigned starting at 0, so the third-world wonder in our enum has a value of 2. You can assign int values that are not listed in the enum. They will output as the int value instead of a name, since a match will not be found. Storing multiple values using an enum type For the bucket list, we could create an array or collection of instances of the enum, and collections as fields will be shown later in this chapter, but there is a better approach for this scenario. We can combine multiple choices into a single value using enum flags. Let’s see how: 1. Modify the enum by decorating it with the [Flags] attribute, and explicitly set a byte value for each wonder that represents different bit columns, as highlighted in the following code: namespace Packt.Shared; [Flags] public enum WondersOfTheAncientWorld : byte { None = 0b_0000_0000, // i.e. 0 GreatPyramidOfGiza = 0b_0000_0001, // i.e. 1 HangingGardensOfBabylon = 0b_0000_0010, // i.e. 2 StatueOfZeusAtOlympia = 0b_0000_0100, // i.e. 4 TempleOfArtemisAtEphesus = 0b_0000_1000, // i.e. 8 MausoleumAtHalicarnassus = 0b_0001_0000, // i.e. 16 ColossusOfRhodes = 0b_0010_0000, // i.e. 32 LighthouseOfAlexandria = 0b_0100_0000 // i.e. 64 } We assign explicit values for each choice that will not overlap when looking at the bits stored in memory. We should also decorate the enum type with the System.Flags attribute so that when the value is returned, it can automatically match with multiple values as a comma-separated string instead of returning an int value. Normally, an enum type uses an int variable internally, but since we don’t need values that big, we can reduce memory requirements by 75%, that is, 1 byte per value instead of 4 bytes, by byte variable. As another example, if you wanted to define an enum for days telling it to use a of the week, there will only ever be seven of them.
