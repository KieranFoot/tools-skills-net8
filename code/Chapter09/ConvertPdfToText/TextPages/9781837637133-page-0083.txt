Managing Relational Data Using SQL Server 50 If a table or column name contains spaces, then you must surround the name in square brackets, like [Order Details]. The SQL scripts to create the Northwind database in- clude the command set quoted_identifier on, so you can also use double quotes, like "Order Details". Single quotes are used for literal text, like 'USA'. Data Manipulation Language (DML) DML is used to query and change data. The most common statement in DML is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. SELECT is extremely complicated because it is so powerful. This book is not about learning T-SQL, so SELECT is to see some examples, as shown in Table 2.3: the quickest way to get a feel for Example Description SELECT * Get all columns of all the employees. FROM Employees SELECT FirstName, LastName Get the first and last name columns of all employees. FROM Employees SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName Give an alias for the table name. Table name prefixes are not needed when there is only one FROM Employees AS emp table, but become useful to disambiguate when there are multiple tables that have columns with the same name, for example, Customers. CustomerId and Orders.CustomerId. SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName Give an alias for the table name without needing the AS keyword. FROM Employees emp SELECT FirstName, LastName AS Surname Give an alias for the column name. FROM Employees SELECT FirstName, LastName Filter the results to only include employees in the USA. FROM Employees WHERE Country = 'USA' SELECT DISTINCT Country Get a list of countries used as values in the Country column of the Employees table without FROM Employees duplicates. SELECT UnitPrice * Quantity AS Subtotal Calculate a subtotal for each order detail row. FROM [Order Details]
