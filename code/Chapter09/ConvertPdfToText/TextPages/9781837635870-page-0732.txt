Chapter 14 713 With Web API controllers, a route like /weatherforecast only tells us the controller class name, for example, WeatherForecastController. To determine the action method name to execute, we must map HTTP methods like GET and POST to methods in the controller class. You should decorate controller methods with the following attributes to indicate the HTTP method that they will respond to: • [HttpGet] and [HttpHead]: These action methods respond to GET or HEAD requests to retrieve a resource and return either the resource and its response headers or just the response headers. • [HttpPost]: This action method responds to POST requests to create a new resource or perform some other action defined by the service. [HttpPut] and [HttpPatch]: These action methods respond to PUT or PATCH requests to update • an existing resource either by replacing it or updating a subset of its properties. [HttpDelete]: This action method responds to DELETE requests to remove a resource. • [HttpOptions]: This action method responds to OPTIONS requests. • Route constraints Route constraints allow us to control matches based on data types and other validation. They are summarized in Table 14.3: Constraint Example Description required {id:required} The parameter has been provided. {id:int} int and long Any integer of the correct size. {unitprice:decimal} decimal, double, Any real number of the correct size. and float bool {discontinued:bool} Case-insensitive match on true or false. datetime {hired:datetime} An invariant culture date/time. guid {id:guid} A GUID value. {title:minlength(5)}, The text must have the defined minlength(n), {title:length(5, 25)} minimum and/or maximum length. maxlength(n), length(n), and length(n, m) {age:range(18, 65)} min(n), max(n), and The integer must be within the defined range(n, m) minimum and/or maximum range. alpha, regex {firstname:alpha}, The parameter must match one or more {id:regex(^[A-Z]{{5}}$)} alphabetic characters or the regular expression.
