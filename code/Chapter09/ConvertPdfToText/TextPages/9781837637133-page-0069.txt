Managing Relational Data Using SQL Server 36 Microsoft offers several sample databases, most of which are too complex for our needs, so instead, we will use a database that was first created in the early 1990s known as Northwind. Let’s take a minute to look at a diagram of the Northwind database and its eight most important tables. You can use the diagram in Figure 2.1 to refer to as we write code and queries throughout this book: Figure 2.1: The Northwind database tables and relationships Note that: • Each category has a unique identifier, name, description, and picture. The picture is stored as a byte array in JPEG format. • Each product has a unique identifier, name, unit price, number of units in stock, and other columns. • Each product is associated with a category by storing the category’s unique identifier. Categories and Products is one-to-many, meaning each category • The relationship between can have zero, one, or more products. Each product is supplied by a supplier company indicated by storing the supplier’s unique • identifier. • The quantity and unit price of a product is stored for each detail of an order. • Each order is made by a customer, taken by an employee, and shipped by a shipping company. • Each employee has a name, address, contact details, birth, and hire dates, a reference to their manager (except for the boss, whose ReportsTo field is null), and a photo stored as a byte array in JPEG format. The table has a one-to-many relationship to itself because one employee can manage many other employees.
