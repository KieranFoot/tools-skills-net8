Chapter 5 175 Running multiple actions synchronously Before we make the tasks run simultaneously, we will run them synchronously, that is, one after the other: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a console app project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Console App / console • Solution file and folder: Chapter05 • Project file and folder: WorkingWithTasks • Do not use top-level statements: Cleared. • Enable native AOT publish: Cleared. In the WorkingWithTasks project, globally and statically import the System.Console class and 2. treat warnings as errors. WorkingWithTasks project, add a new class file named Program.Helpers.cs. 3. In the In Program.Helpers.cs, delete any existing statements, and then define a partial Program 4. class with methods to output a section title and a task title, and to output information about the current thread, each in different colors to make them easier to identify in output, as shown in the following code: partial class Program { private static void SectionTitle(string title) { ConsoleColor previousColor = ForegroundColor; ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkYellow; WriteLine($"*** {title}"); ForegroundColor = previousColor; } private static void TaskTitle(string title) { ConsoleColor previousColor = ForegroundColor; ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green; WriteLine($"{title}"); ForegroundColor = previousColor; } private static void OutputThreadInfo() { Thread t = Thread.CurrentThread;
