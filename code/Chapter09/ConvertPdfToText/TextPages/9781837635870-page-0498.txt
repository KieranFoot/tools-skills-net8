In Program.cs, add statements to enumerate the Viper call signs, writing each one on its own line in a single text file, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Writing to text streams"); // Define a file to write to. string textFile = Combine(CurrentDirectory, "streams.txt"); // Create a text file and return a helper writer. StreamWriter text = File.CreateText(textFile); // Enumerate the strings, writing each one to the stream // on a separate line. foreach (string item in Viper.Callsigns) { text.WriteLine(item); } text.Close(); // Release unmanaged file resources. OutputFileInfo(textFile); Calling Close on the stream writer helper will call Close on the underlying stream. This in turn calls Dispose to release unmanaged file resources. 9.
