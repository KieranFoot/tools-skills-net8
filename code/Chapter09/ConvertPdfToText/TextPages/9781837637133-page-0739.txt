Building Mobile and Desktop Apps Using .NET MAUI 706 .NET MAUI namespaces .NET MAUI has several important namespaces where its types are defined, as shown in Table 16.1: Namespace Description Microsoft.Maui Utility types like FlowDirection, IButton, IImage, and Thickness. Microsoft.Maui.Controls Common controls, pages, and related types like Application, Brush, Button, CheckBox, ContentPage, Image, and VerticalStackPanel. Microsoft.Maui.Graphics Types for graphics like Color, Font, ImageFormat, PathBuilder, Point, and Size. Table 16.1: Important MAUI namespaces To import a namespace using XAML, in the root element you add xmlns attributes. One namespace is imported as the default, and others must be named using a prefix. For example, .NET MAUI types are imported by default, so the element names do not need a prefix; general XAML syntax is imported using the x prefix for doing common things like naming a control or the class name that the XAML will be compiled as. Your project types are often imported using the local prefix, as shown in the following markup: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml" xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MyMauiApp.Controls" x:Class="MyMauiApp.MainPage" ...> <Button x:Name="NewFileButton" ...>New File</Button> <local:CustomerList x:Name="CustomerList" ... /> ... </ContentPage> In the example above, the project is named MyMauiApp and its controls like the CustomerList control are defined in a namespace named MyMauiApp.Controls. This namespace has been registered with the prefix local, so when an instance of the CustomerList control is needed, it is declared using <local:CustomerList>. You can import as many namespaces with different prefixes as you need. Type converters Type converters convert XAML attribute values that must be set as string values into other types. For example, the following button has its Background property set to the string value "Pink": <Button x:Name="newButton" Background="Pink" ...
