Speaking C# 54 C# language versions and features This part of the book covers the C# programming language and is written primarily for beginners, so it covers the fundamental topics that all developers need to know, including declaring variables, storing data, and how to define your own custom data types. This book covers features of the C# language from version 1 up to the latest version, 12. If you already have some familiarity with older versions of C# and are excited to find out about the new features in the most recent versions of C#, I have made it easier for you to jump around by listing language versions and their important new features below, along with the chapter number and topic title where you can learn about them. You can read this information in the GitHub repository at the following link: https://github.com/ markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch02-features.md Understanding C# standards Over the years, Microsoft has submitted a few versions of C# to standards bodies, as shown in Table 2.1: C# version ECMA standard ISO/IEC standard 1.0 ECMA-334:2003 ISO/IEC 23270:2003 2.0 ECMA-334:2006 ISO/IEC 23270:2006 5.0 ECMA-334:2017 ISO/IEC 23270:2018 6.0 ECMA-334:2022 ISO/IEC 23270:2022 Table 2.1: ECMA standards for C# The ECMA standard for C# 7.3 is still a draft. So donâ€™t even think about when C# versions 8 to 12 might be ECMA standards! Microsoft made C# open source in 2014. You can read the latest C# standard document at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/ en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/specifications. More practically useful than the ECMA standards are the public GitHub repositories for making the work on C# and related technologies as open as possible, as shown in Table 2.2: Description Link https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang C# language design https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn Compiler implementation https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard Standard to describe the language Table 2.2: Public GitHub repositories for C#
