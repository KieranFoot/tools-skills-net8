Querying and Manipulating Data Using LINQ 624 7. What does the last type parameter T in generic Func delegates like Func<T1, T2, T> represent? 8. What is the benefit of a LINQ extension method that ends with OrDefault? 9. Why is query comprehension syntax optional? 10. How can you create your own LINQ extension methods? Exercise 11.2 – Practice querying with LINQ In the Chapter11 solution, create a console application, named Ch11Ex02LinqQueries, that prompts the user for a city and then lists the company names for Northwind customers in that city, as shown in the following output: Enter the name of a city: London There are 6 customers in London: Around the Horn B's Beverages Consolidated Holdings Eastern Connection North/South Seven Seas Imports Then, enhance the application by displaying a list of all unique cities that customers already reside in as a prompt to the user before they enter their preferred city, as shown in the following output: Aachen, Albuquerque, Anchorage, Århus, Barcelona, Barquisimeto, Bergamo, Berlin, Bern, Boise, Bräcke, Brandenburg, Bruxelles, Buenos Aires, Butte, Campinas, Caracas, Charleroi, Cork, Cowes, Cunewalde, Elgin, Eugene, Frankfurt a.M., Genève, Graz, Helsinki, I. de Margarita, Kirkland, Kobenhavn, Köln, Lander, Leipzig, Lille, Lisboa, London, Luleå, Lyon, Madrid, Mannheim, Marseille, México D.F., Montréal, München, Münster, Nantes, Oulu, Paris, Portland, Reggio Emilia, Reims, Resende, Rio de Janeiro, Salzburg, San Cristóbal, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Sevilla, Stavern, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Torino, Toulouse, Tsawassen, Vancouver, Versailles, Walla Walla, Warszawa Exercise 11.3 – Using multiple threads with parallel LINQ You can improve performance and scalability by using multiple threads to run LINQ queries.
