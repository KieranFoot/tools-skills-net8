Chapter 4 171 1. What are the five APIs supported by Azure Cosmos DB? 2. At what level do you select the API: account, database, container, or partition? 3. What does embed mean regarding data modeling with Cosmos DB? What is the unit of measurement for throughput for Cosmos DB and what does 1 unit represent? 4. 5. What package should you reference to programmatically work with Cosmos DB resources? What language do you use to write Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API user-defined functions and 6. stored procedures? Exercise 4.2 – Practice data modeling and partitioning Microsoft documentation has an extensive example of modeling and partitioning Azure Cosmos DB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-model-partition-example Exercise 4.3 – Explore topics Use the links on the following page to learn more details about the topics covered in this chapter: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/book-links.md#chapter- 4---managing-nosql-data-using-azure-cosmos-db Exercise 4.4 – Download cheat sheets Download query cheat sheets for the Azure Cosmos DB APIs and review them: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/query-cheat-sheet Exercise 4.5 – Explore the Gremlin API for Cosmos DB If you are interested, then I have written an optional online-only section where you explore the Azure Cosmos DB graph API that uses the Gremlin API, found at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch04-gremlin.md To gain more experience with the Gremlin graph API, you could read the following online book: https://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.html Exercise 4.6 – Explore NoSQL databases This chapter focused on Azure Cosmos DB. If you wish to learn more about NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, and how to use them with EF Core, then I recommend the following links: • Use NoSQL databases as a persistence infrastructure: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/nosql- database-persistence-infrastructure • Document Database Providers for Entity Framework Core: https://github.com/ BlueshiftSoftware/EntityFrameworkCore
