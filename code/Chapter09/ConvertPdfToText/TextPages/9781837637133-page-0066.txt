Chapter 1 33 Subscribing to the official .NET blog and announcements To keep up to date with .NET, an excellent blog to subscribe to is the official .NET blog, written by the .NET engineering teams, and you can find it at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft. . com/dotnet/ I also recommend that you subscribe to the official .NET announcements repository at the following link: https://github.com/dotnet/announcements. Practicing and exploring Test your knowledge and understanding by answering some questions, getting some hands-on practice, and exploring with deeper research the topics in this chapter. Exercise 1.1 – Test your knowledge Use the web to answer the following questions: 1. Why is it good practice to add the following setting to your project files? And when should you not set it? <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> 2. Which service technology requires a minimum HTTP version of 2? 3.

Exercise 1.2 – Review the online-only sections To preserve space in the print book, there are some optional online-only sections available in the GitHub repository. They are not needed for the rest of the book, but you will find them useful for general knowledge: • What’s New in Modern C# and .NET: In this section, the goal is to review what is new since C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0, which were released in 2016. Instead of just listing the new features introduced with each version of .NET, this section takes a themed approach to make it easier to understand how small individual improvements introduced over multiple versions are designed to work together. This section will also be updated throughout the lifetime of .NET 8, from November 2023 to November 2026. This will include new language and library features introduced in .NET 9 and .NET 10 (https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/ ). blob/main/docs/ch01-whats-new.md • Benchmarking Performance and Testing: In this section, you will learn how to use types in System.Diagnostics namespace and the Benchmark.NET library to monitor your code the to measure performance and efficiency (https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services- ). net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-benchmarking.md
