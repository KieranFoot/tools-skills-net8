Building Web Components Using Blazor 684 3. In the Components\Pages folder, in Home.razor, at the bottom of the file, add statements to define a Bootstrap row with two equal columns, and add a <ProgressBar> component set to 25%, as shown in the following markup: <div class="row"> <div class="col"> <div class="alert alert-info"> <h4>Progress of database deletion</h4> <ProgressBar Value="25" IsAnimated="true" ShowValue="true" LabelText="Progress of database deletion" /> </div> </div> <div class="col"> More components coming soon. </div> </div> 4. Start the Northind.Blazor project, using its https profile without debugging. 5. Note the progress bar that shows the progress of the (simulated!) database deletion. 6. Close the browser and shut down the web server. Building a Blazor dialog box component In this section, we will build a component to provide a popup dialog box for interaction with the website visitor. It will use Bootstrap classes to define a button that, when clicked, shows a dialog box with two buttons with configurable labels. By default, the Blazor Web App project template uses a local copy of Bootstrap 5.1 but only the CSS part. We will need to add a script tag to add the JavaScript parts of Bootstrap. We may as well upgrade to the latest version of Bootstrap and use the CDN version too. You can find the latest CDN links at the following link: https://getbootstrap.com/ docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/#cdn-links. The component will also define two event callbacks that can be handled by the parent to customize what code executes when the two buttons are clicked. 1. In App.razor, comment out the <link> to the local CSS file and add a reference to the latest CDN version, as shown highlighted in the following markup: @*<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" />*@ <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-T3 c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN" crossorigin="anonymous">
