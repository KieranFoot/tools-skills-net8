Chapter 5 233 Building class libraries Class library assemblies group types together into easily deployable units (DLL files). Apart from when you learned about unit testing, you have only created console apps to contain your code. To make the code that you write reusable across multiple projects, you should put it in class library assemblies, just like Microsoft does. Creating a class library The first task is to create a reusable .NET class library: 1. Use your preferred coding tool to create a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Class Library / classlib • Project file and folder: PacktLibraryNetStandard2 • Solution file and folder: Chapter05 2. Open the PacktLibraryNetStandard2.csproj file, and note that, by default, class libraries created by the .NET 8 SDK target .NET 8 and, therefore, can only be referenced by other .NET 8-compatible assemblies, as highlighted in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> </PropertyGroup> </Project> 3. Modify the framework to target .NET Standard 2.0, add an entry to explicitly use the C# 12 compiler, and statically import the System.Console class for all C# files, as highlighted in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <!--.NET Standard 2.0 class library can be used by: .NET Framework, Xamarin, modern .NET. --> <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework> <!--Compile this library using C# 12 so we can use most modern compiler features. --> <LangVersion>12</LangVersion>
