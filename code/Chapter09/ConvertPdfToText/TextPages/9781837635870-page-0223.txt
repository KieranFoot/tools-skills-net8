Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions 204 Figure 4.17: Visual Studio 2022 Output window shows Debug output including the two mes- sages Configuring trace listeners Now, we will configure another trace listener that will write to a text file: 1. Before the Debug and Trace calls to WriteLine, add statements to create a new text file on the desktop and pass it into a new trace listener that knows how to write to a text file, and enable automatic flushing for its buffer during development, as shown in the following code: string logPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath( Environment.SpecialFolder.DesktopDirectory), "log.txt"); Console.WriteLine($"Writing to: {logPath}"); TextWriterTraceListener logFile = new(File.CreateText(logPath)); Trace.Listeners.Add(logFile); #if DEBUG // Text writer is buffered, so this option calls // Flush() on all listeners after writing. Trace.AutoFlush = true; #endif
