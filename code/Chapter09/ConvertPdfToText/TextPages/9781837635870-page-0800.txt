Epilogue I wanted this book to be different from others on the market. I hope that you found it to be a brisk, fun read, packed with practical, hands-on walk-throughs of each subject. This epilogue contains the following short sections: • Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey • The ninth edition, coming November 2024 • Good luck! Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey For subjects that I didn’t have space to include in this book but you might want to learn more about, I hope that the notes, good practice tips, and links in the GitHub repository point you in the right direction: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/book-links.md Polishing your skills with design guidelines Now that you have learned the fundamentals of developing using C# and .NET, you are ready to im- prove the quality of your code by learning more detailed design guidelines. Back in the early .NET Framework era, Microsoft published a book that gave good practices in all areas of .NET development. Those recommendations are still very much applicable to modern .NET development. The following topics are covered: • Naming Guidelines • Type Design Guidelines • Member Design Guidelines • Designing for Extensibility • Design Guidelines for Exceptions • Usage Guidelines • Common Design Patterns To make the guidance as easy to follow as possible, the recommendations are simply labeled with the terms Do, Consider, Avoid, and Do not. Microsoft has made excerpts of the book available at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/
