Chapter 4 193 Figure 4.6: Break mode in Visual Studio Code Navigating with the debugging toolbar Visual Studio 2022 has two debug-related buttons in its Standard toolbar to start or continue debugging and to hot reload changes to the running code, and a separate Debug toolbar for the rest of the tools. Visual Studio Code shows a floating toolbar with buttons to make it easy to access debugging features. Both are shown in Figure 4.7: Figure 4.7: Debugging toolbars in Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code The following list describes the most common buttons in the toolbars: • Start/Continue/F5: This button is context-sensitive. It will either start a project running or continue running the project from the current position until it ends or hits a breakpoint. Hot Reload: This button will reload compiled code changes without needing to restart the app. • • Break All: This button will break into the next available line of code in a running app. • Stop Debugging/Stop/Shift + F5 (red square): This button will stop the debugging session.
