Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 34 Making good use of the GitHub repository for this book Git is a commonly used source code management system. GitHub is a company, website, and desktop application that makes it easier to manage Git. Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018, so it will continue to get closer integration with Microsoft tools. I created a GitHub repository for this book, and I use it for the following: • To store the solution code for the book that can be maintained after the print publication date. • To provide extra materials that extend the book, like errata fixes, small improvements, lists of useful links, and optional sections about topics that cannot fit in the printed book. • To provide a place for readers to get in touch with me if they have issues with the book. Good Practice: I strongly recommend that all readers review the errata, improvements, post-publication changes, and common errors pages before attempting any coding task in this book. You can find them at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/ cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/errata.md. Understanding the solution code on GitHub The solution code in the GitHub repository for this book includes folders for each chapter that can be opened with any of the following code editors: • Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider: Open the .sln solution file. • Visual Studio Code: Open the folder that contains the solution file. ChapterXX.sln where XX is the chapter num- Chapters 1 to 11 each have their own solution file named ber. Chapters 12 to 15 share a single solution file named PracticalApps.sln. All the code solutions can be found at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/tree/main/code Good Practice: If you need to, return to this chapter to remind yourself how to create and manage multiple projects in the code editor of your choice. The GitHub repository has step-by-step instructions for three code editors (Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider), along with additional screenshots: https://github.com/markjprice/ cs12dotnet8/tree/main/docs/code-editors/. Raising issues with the book If you get stuck following any of the instructions in this book, or if you spot a mistake in the text or the code in the solutions, please raise an issue in the GitHub repository: 1.
