These are created by using a component named NavLink, as shown in the following markup: <div class="top-row ps-3 navbar navbar-dark"> <div class="container-fluid"> <a class="navbar-brand" href="">Northwind.Blazor</a> </div> </div> <input type="checkbox" title="Navigation menu" class="navbar-toggler" /> <div class="nav-scrollable" onclick= "document.querySelector('.navbar-toggler').click()"> <nav class="flex-column"> <div class="nav-item px-3"> <NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"> <span class="bi bi-house-door-fill" aria-hidden="true"></span> Home </NavLink> </div> <div class="nav-item px-3"> <NavLink class="nav-link" href="weather"> <span class="bi bi-list-nested" aria-hidden="true"></span> Weather </NavLink> </div> </nav> </div> 7.
