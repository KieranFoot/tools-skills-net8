Chapter 5 257 public class Book { // Constructor for use with object initializer syntax. public Book() { } // Constructor with parameters to set required fields. public Book(string? isbn, string? title) { Isbn = isbn; Title = title; } 2. In Program.cs, comment out the statement that instantiates a book using object initializer syntax, add a statement to instantiate a book using the constructor, and then set the non-re- properties for the book, as highlighted in the following code: quired /* // Instantiate a book using object initializer syntax. Book book = new() { Isbn = "978-1803237800", Title = "C# 12 and .NET 8 - Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals" }; */ Book book = new(isbn: "978-1803237800", title: "C# 12 and .NET 8 - Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals") { Author = "Mark J. Price", PageCount = 821 }; 3. Note that you will see a compiler error as before, because the compiler cannot automatically tell that calling the constructor will have set the two required properties. PacktLibraryModern project, in Book.cs, import the namespace to perform code anal- 4. In the ysis, and then decorate the constructor with the attribute to tell the compiler that it sets all the required properties and fields, as highlighted in the following code: using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis; // To use [SetsRequiredMembers]. namespace Packt.Shared;
