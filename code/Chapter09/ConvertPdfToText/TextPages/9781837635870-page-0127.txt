Speaking C# 108 enumType: typeof(ConsoleColor), value: args[0], ignoreCase: true); BackgroundColor = (ConsoleColor)Enum.Parse( enumType: typeof(ConsoleColor), value: args[1], ignoreCase: true); CursorSize = int.Parse(args[2]); Note the compiler warning that setting the CursorSize is only supported on Win- dows. For now, do not worry about most of this code like (ConsoleColor), Enum.
