Enabling client-side execution using WebAssembly .NET 8 Release Candidate 1 had a go-live license but the changes to Blazor were so ambitious that the client-side support was not finished in time for the final drafts of this book. We put the final section of this book online so that it could be updated to use the general availability release of .NET 8, which should complete the client-side functionality of Blazor. You can find the final section at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch15-blazor-wasm.md
