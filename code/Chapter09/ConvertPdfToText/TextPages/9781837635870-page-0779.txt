Building User Interfaces Using Blazor 760 4. In the left navigation menu, click Weather, as shown in Figure 15.1: Figure 15.1: Fetching weather data into a Blazor Web App project 5. Close Chrome and shut down the web server. Building components using Blazor In this section, we will build a component to list, create, and edit customers in the Northwind database. We will build it over several steps: 1. Make a Blazor component that renders the name of a country set as a parameter. 2. Make it work as a routable page as well as a component. 3. Implement the functionality to perform CRUD operations on customers in a database. Defining and testing a simple Blazor component We will add the new component to the existing Blazor Web App project: 1. In the Northwind.Blazor project, in the Components\Pages folder, add a new file named Customers.razor. In Visual Studio 2022, the project item template is named Razor Component. In JetBrains Rider, the project item template is named Blazor Component. Good Practice: Blazor component filenames must start with an uppercase letter, or you will have compile errors! 2. Add statements to output a heading for the Customers component and define a code block that defines a property to store the name of a country, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <h3> Customers @(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Country) ? "Worldwide" : "in " + Country) </h3>
