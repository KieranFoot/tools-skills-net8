12 Introducing Web Development Using ASP.NET Core The third and final part of this book is about web development using ASP.NET Core. You will learn how to build cross-platform projects such as websites, web services, and web browser apps. Microsoft calls platforms for building applications app models or workloads. I recommend that you work through this and subsequent chapters sequentially because later chapters will reference projects in earlier chapters, and you will build up sufficient knowledge and skills to tackle the trickier problems in later chapters. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: • Understanding ASP.NET Core • New features in ASP.NET Core • Structuring projects • Building an entity model for use in the rest of the book • Understanding web development Understanding ASP.NET Core Since this book is about C# and .NET, we will learn about app models that use them to build the prac- tical applications that we will encounter in the remaining chapters of this book. More Information: Microsoft has extensive guidance for implementing app models in its .NET Architecture Guides documentation, which you can read at the following link: https:// dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/architecture-guides.
