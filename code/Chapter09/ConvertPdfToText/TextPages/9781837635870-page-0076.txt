Chapter 2 57 After you’ve installed a .NET 9 SDK preview, you will be able to use it to create new projects and explore the new language features in C# 13. After creating a new project, you can edit the .csproj file and add the <LangVersion> element set to preview to use the preview C# 13 compiler, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <OutputType>Exe</OutputType> <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework> <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion> </PropertyGroup> </Project> Switching the C# compiler for .NET 8 to a future version .NET 8 is an LTS release, so Microsoft must support developers who continue to use .NET 8 for three years. But that does not mean that you are stuck with the C# 12 compiler for three years! In November 2024, Microsoft is likely to release .NET 9, including a C# 13 compiler with new features. Although future versions of .NET 8 are likely to include preview versions of the C# 13 compiler, to be properly supported by Microsoft, you should only set <LangVersion> to preview for exploration, not production projects, because it is not supported by Microsoft, and it is more likely to have bugs. Microsoft makes previews available because they want to hear feedback. You can be a part of C#’s development and improvement. Once the .NET 9 SDK is made generally available in November 2024, you will be able to get the best of both worlds. You can use the .NET 9 SDK and its C# 13 compiler while your projects continue to target .NET 8. To do so, set the target framework to net8.0 and add a <LangVersion> element set to 13, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <OutputType>Exe</OutputType> <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <LangVersion>13</LangVersion> </PropertyGroup> </Project> The preceding project targets net8.0, so it is supported until November 2026 when run on a monthly patched version of the .NET 8 runtime. If the preceding project is built using .NET 9 SDK, then it can have the <LangVersion> set to 13, meaning C# 13. If you target net9.0, which new projects will by default if you have installed the .NET 9 SDK, then the default language will be C# 13 so it would not need to be explicitly set.
