Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 536 3. Start a command prompt or terminal in the WorkingWithEFCore project folder. For example: • If you are using Visual Studio 2022, in Solution Explorer, right-click the WorkingWithEFCore project and select Open in Terminal. WorkingWithEFCore folder, and select • On Windows, start File Explorer, right-click the New Command Prompt at Folder or Open in Windows Terminal. On macOS, start Finder, right-click the WorkingWithEFCore folder, and select New • Terminal at Folder. If you are using JetBrains Rider, in Solution Explorer, right-click the WorkingWithEFCore • project and select Open In | Terminal. Warning! When I say the WorkingWithEFCore project folder, I mean the folder that contains the WorkingWithEFCore.csproj project file. If you enter the command in a folder that does not contain a project file, then you will see the following error: No project was found. Change the current working directory or use the --project option. Good Practice: You are about to enter a long command. I recommend that you type from the print book or copy and paste long commands like this from the eBook into a plain text editor like Notepad. Then make sure that the whole command is properly formatted as a single line with correct spacing. Only then should you copy and paste it into the command prompt or terminal. Copying and pasting directly from the eBook is likely to include newline characters and missing spaces that break the command if you aren’t careful. Also remember that all commands are available to copy from at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/ cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/command-lines.md. 4. At a command prompt or terminal, use the dotnet-ef tool to generate a model for the Categories and Products tables in a new folder named AutoGenModels, as shown in the fol- lowing command and in Figure 10.6: dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=Northwind.db" Microsoft. EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --table Categories --table Products --output- dir AutoGenModels --namespace WorkingWithEFCore.AutoGen --data- annotations --context NorthwindDb Note the following: • The command action: dbcontext scaffold • The connection string: "Data Source=Northwind.db" • The database provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite • The tables to generate models for: --table Categories --table Products • The output folder: --output-dir AutoGenModels
