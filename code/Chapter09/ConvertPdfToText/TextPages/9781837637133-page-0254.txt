WriteLine($"Now (UTC): {now}"); WriteLine("Add 3 hours, Humanized: {0}", now.AddHours(3).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 3 hours and 1 minute, Humanized: {0}", now.AddHours(3).AddMinutes(1).Humanize()); WriteLine("Subtract 3 hours, Humanized: {0}", now.AddHours(-3).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 24 hours, Humanized: {0}", now.AddHours(24).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 25 hours, Humanized: {0}", now.AddHours(25).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 7 days, Humanized: {0}", now.AddDays(7).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 7 days and 1 minute, Humanized: {0}", now.AddDays(7).AddMinutes(1).Humanize()); WriteLine("Add 1 month, Humanized: {0}", now.AddMonths(1).Humanize());
