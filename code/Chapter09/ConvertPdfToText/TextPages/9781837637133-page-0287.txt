Handling Dates, Times, and Internationalization 254 Specifying date and time values A common way to create a date and time value is to specify individual values for the date and time components, like day and hour, as described in Table 7.1: Date/time parameter Value range year 1 to 9,999 month 1 to 12 day 1 to the number of days in that month hour 0 to 23 minute 0 to 59 second 0 to 59 millisecond 0 to 999 microsecond 0 to 999 Table 7.1: Parameters for formatting date and time values For example, to instantiate a DateTime that represents when .NET 9 might be released for General Availability, as shown in the following code: DateTime dotnet9GA = new(year: 2024, month: 11, day: 12, hour: 11, minute: 0, second: 0); Good Practice: The preceding code example might make you think, “What time zone does the value represent?” This is the big problem with DateTime and why it is good practice to avoid it in favor of DateTimeOffset, which stores the time zone too. We will look at this issue in more detail later in this chapter. An alternative is to provide the value as a string to be parsed, but this can be misinterpreted depending on the default culture of the thread. For example, in the UK, dates are specified as day/month/year, whereas in the US, dates are specified as month/day/year. Let’s see what you might want to do with dates and times: 1. Use your preferred code editor to create a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Console App / console • Project file and folder: WorkingWithTime • Solution file and folder: Chapter07 • Do not use top-level statements: Cleared. • Enable native AOT publish: Cleared. In the project file, treat warnings as errors, and add an element to statically and globally import 2. the System.Console class.
