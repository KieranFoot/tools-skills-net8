Chapter 1 47 It responds with a complete class with methods, as shown in Figure 1.22: Figure 1.22: ChatGPT writes a function to validate an email address It then provides an explanation of the code and examples of how to call the function, as shown in the following code: bool isValid = EmailValidator.IsValidEmail("test@example.com"); Console.WriteLine(isValid ? "Valid" : "Invalid"); But is a general-purpose generative AI like ChatGPT the best partner for a C# programmer? Microsoft has a service specifically for programmers, named GitHub Copilot, that can help autocom- plete code directly in your code editor. It is being enhanced with more intelligence using GPT-4.

It makes it clear that you are the pilot. You are ultimately responsible for “flying the plane.” But for the easy or boring bits, you can hand it over to your co-pilot for a bit, while being actively ready to take back control if needed.
