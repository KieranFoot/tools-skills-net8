1 Introducing Apps and Services with .NET In this first chapter, the goals are setting up your development environment to use Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code and understanding your choices for building apps and services; we will review good places to look for help. The GitHub repository for this book has solutions using full application projects for all code tasks: https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/ After going to the GitHub repository, simply press the . (dot) key on your keyboard or change .com to .dev to change the repository into a live code editor based on Visual Studio Code using GitHub Codespaces. Visual Studio Code in a web browser is great to run alongside your chosen code editor as you work through the book’s coding tasks. You can compare your code to the solution code and easily copy and paste parts if needed. Throughout this book, I use the term modern .NET to refer to .NET 8 and its predecessors like .NET 6, which come from .NET Core. I use the term legacy .NET to refer to .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard. Modern .NET is a unification of those legacy platforms and standards. This chapter covers the following topics: • Introducing this book and its contents • App and service technologies • Setting up your development environment • Exploring top-level programs, functions, and namespaces • Making good use of the GitHub repository for this book • Where to go for help
