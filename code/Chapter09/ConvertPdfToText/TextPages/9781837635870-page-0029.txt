Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 10 Letâ€™s now download and install Visual Studio Code, the .NET SDK, and the C# Dev Kit extension: 1. Download and install either the Stable build or the Insiders edition of Visual Studio Code from the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/. More Information: If you need more help installing Visual Studio Code, you can read the official setup guide at the following link: https://code.visualstudio. com/docs/setup/setup-overview. 2. Download and install the .NET SDK for version 8.0 and at least one other version like 6.0 or 7.0 from the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download. In real life, you are extremely unlikely to only have one .NET SDK version installed on your computer. To learn how to control which .NET SDK version is used to build a project, we need multiple versions installed. .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8 are sup- ported versions at the time of publishing in November 2023. You can safely install multiple SDKs side by side. The most recent SDK will be used to build your projects. 3. To install the C# Dev Kit extension with a user interface, you must first launch the Visual Studio Code application. 4. In Visual Studio Code, click the Extensions icon or navigate to View | Extensions. 5. C# Dev Kit is one of the most popular extensions available, so you should see it at the top of C# in the search box. the list, or you can enter C# Dev Kit has a dependency on the C# extension version 2.0 or later, so you do not have to install the C# extension separately. Note that C# extension version 2.0 or later no longer uses OmniSharp since it has a new Language Service Protocol (LSP) host. C# Dev Kit also has dependencies on the .NET Install Tool for Extension Authors and IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extensions so they will be installed too. 6. Click Install and wait for supporting packages to download and install. Good Practice: Be sure to read the license agreement for C# Dev Kit. It has a more restric- tive license than the C# extension: https://aka.ms/vs/csdevkit/license. Installing other extensions In later chapters of this book, you will use more Visual Studio Code extensions. If you want to install them now, all the extensions that we will use are shown in Table 1.1:
