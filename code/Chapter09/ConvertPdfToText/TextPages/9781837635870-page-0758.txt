Chapter 14 739 Starting multiple projects Up to this point, we have only started one project at a time. Now we have two projects that need to be started, a web service and an MVC client website. In the step-by-step instructions, I will only tell you to start individual projects one at a time, but you should use whatever technique you prefer to start them. If you are using Visual Studio 2022 Visual Studio 2022 can start multiple projects manually one by one if the debugger is not attached, as described in the following steps: 1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution or any project and then select Configure Startup Projects…, or select the solution and navigate to Project | Configure Startup Projects…. 2. In the Solution ‘<name>’ Property Pages dialog box, select Current selection. 3. Click OK. 4. Select a project in Solution Explorer so that its name becomes bold. 5. Navigate to Debug | Start Without Debugging or press Ctrl + F5. 6. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for as many projects as you need. If you need to debug the projects, then you must start multiple instances of Visual Studio 2022. Each instance can start a single project with debugging. You can also configure multiple projects to start up at the same time using the following steps: 1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution or any project and then select Configure Startup Projects…, or select the solution and navigate to Project | Configure Startup Projects…. 2. In the Solution ‘<name>’ Property Pages dialog box, select Multiple startup projects, and for any projects that you want to start, select either Start or Start without debugging, as shown in Figure 14.11: Figure 14.11: Selecting multiple projects to start up in Visual Studio 2022
