Chapter 15 767 A transient service is one that creates a new instance for each request. You can read more about the different lifetimes for services at the following link: https:// learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency- injection#service-lifetimes. 12. In the Components folder, in _Imports.razor, import the namespace for working with the Northwind entities and our service so that Blazor components that we build do not need to import the namespaces individually, as shown in the following markup: @using Northwind.Blazor.Services @* To use INorthwindService. *@ @using Northwind.EntityModels @* To use Northwind entities. *@ The _Imports.razor file only applies to .razor files. If you use code-behind .cs files to implement component code, then they must have namespaces imported separately or use global usings to implicitly import the namespaces. 13. In the Components\Pages folder, in Customers.razor, add statements to inject the service and then use it to output a table of all customers using synchronous database operations, as shown highlighted in the following code: @page "/customers/{country?}" @inject INorthwindService _service <h3> Customers @(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Country) ? "Worldwide" : "in " + Country) </h3> @if (customers is null) { <p><em>Loading...</em></p> } else { <table class="table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Id</th> <th>Company Name</th> <th>Address</th> <th>Phone</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>
