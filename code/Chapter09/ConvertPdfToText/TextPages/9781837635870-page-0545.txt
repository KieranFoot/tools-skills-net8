Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core 526 • The primary key is assumed to be a property that is named Id or ID, or when the entity model class is named Product, then the property can be named ProductId or ProductID. If this property is an integer type or the Guid type, then it is also assumed to be an IDENTITY column (a column type that automatically assigns a value when inserting). Good Practice: There are many other conventions that you should know, and you can even define your own, but that is beyond the scope of this book. You can read about them at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/. Using EF Core annotation attributes to define the model Conventions often aren’t enough to completely map the classes to the database objects. A simple way of making your model smarter is to apply annotation attributes. Some common attributes recognized by EF Core are shown in Table 10.2: Attribute Description Ensures the value is not null. In .NET 8, it has a [Required] DisallowAllDefaultValues parameter to prevent value types having their default value. For example, an int cannot be 0. [StringLength(50)] Ensures the value is up to 50 characters in length. [Column(TypeName = "money", Specifies the column type and column name used in the table. Name = "UnitPrice")] Table 10.2: Common EF Core annotation attributes Some additional attributes that can be used to validate entities and are recognized by platforms like ASP.NET Core and Blazor for validation are shown in Table 10.3: Attribute Description Ensures the value matches the specified regular [RegularExpression(expression)] expression. Ensures the value contains one @ symbol, but not as [EmailAddress] the first or last character. It does not use a regular expression. Ensures a double, int, or string value within a [Range(1, 10)] specified range. New in .NET 8 are the parameters MinimumIsExclusive and MaximumIsExclusive. Ensures a string or collection is within a specified [Length(10, 20)] length range, for example, minimum 10 characters or items, maximum 20 characters or items. [Base64String] Ensures the value is a well-formed Base64 string.
