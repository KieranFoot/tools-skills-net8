Delete the Class1.cs file. Northwind.Common.EntityModels.SqlServer project. 4. Build the Northwind.Common.EntityModels.SqlServer 5. Open a command prompt or terminal for the folder. The next step assumes a database connection string for a local SQL Server au- thenticated with Windows integrated security. Modify it for Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Edge with a user ID and password if necessary. 6. At the command line, generate entity class models for all tables, as shown in the following commands: dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --namespace Northwind. EntityModels --data-annotations Note the following: • The command to perform: dbcontext scaffold. The connection string: "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated • Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=True;" .
