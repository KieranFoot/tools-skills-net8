Building Mobile and Desktop Apps Using .NET MAUI 726 20. Add a statement to the event handler method that sets the content of the button to the current time, as shown highlighted in the following code: private void ClickMeButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ClickMeButton.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh:mm:ss"); } 21. Start the Northwind.Maui.Client project on at least one mobile device and one desktop device. Good Practice: When deploying to an Android emulator or an iOS simulator, the old version of the app could still be running. Make sure to wait for the deployment of the new version of your app before interacting with it. You can keep an eye on the Visual Studio status bar to track the deployment progress or just wait until you see the message XAML Hot Reload connected. 22. Navigate to Categories, click the button, and note that its text label changes to the current time. 23. Close the app. Implementing more content pages Now, letâ€™s implement some of the new pages: 1. In EmployeesPage.xaml, change the Title to Employees and add markup to define the UI for a simple calculator, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml" x:Class="Northwind.Maui.Client.EmployeesPage" Title="Employees"> <VerticalStackLayout> <Grid Background="DarkGray" Margin="10" Padding="5" x:Name="GridCalculator" ColumnDefinitions="Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto" RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto"> <Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Text="X" /> <Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1" Text="/" /> <Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="2" Text="+" /> <Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="3" Text="-" /> <Button Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="0" Text="7" /> <Button Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1" Text="8" /> <Button Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="2" Text="9" />
