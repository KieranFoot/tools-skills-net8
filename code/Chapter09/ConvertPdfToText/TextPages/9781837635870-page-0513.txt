Working with Files, Streams, and Serialization 494 public class Person { public Person(decimal initialSalary) { Salary = initialSalary; } public string? FirstName { get; set; } public string? LastName { get; set; } public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; } public HashSet<Person>? Children { get; set; } protected decimal Salary { get; set; } } 6. In Program.cs, delete the existing statements, and then import namespaces to work with XML serialization and the Person class, as shown in the following code: using System.Xml.Serialization; // To use XmlSerializer. using Packt.Shared; // To use Person. 7. In Program.cs, add statements to create an object graph of Person instances, as shown in the following code: List<Person> people = new() { new(initialSalary: 30_000M) { FirstName = "Alice", LastName = "Smith", DateOfBirth = new(year: 1974, month: 3, day: 14) }, new(initialSalary: 40_000M) { FirstName = "Bob", LastName = "Jones", DateOfBirth = new(year: 1969, month: 11, day: 23) }, new(initialSalary: 20_000M) { FirstName = "Charlie", LastName = "Cox", DateOfBirth = new(year: 1984, month: 5, day: 4), Children = new()
