Querying and Manipulating Data Using LINQ 598 Using LINQ with EF Core We have looked at LINQ queries that filter and sort, but none that change the shape of the items in the sequence. This is called projection because itâ€™s about projecting items of one shape into another shape. To learn about projection, it is best to have some more complex types to work with, so in the next proj- string sequences, we will use sequences of entities from the Northwind sample ect, instead of using database that you were introduced to in Chapter 10, Working with Data Using Entity Framework Core. I will give instructions to use SQLite because it is cross-platform, but if you prefer to use SQL Server then feel free to do so. I have included some commented code to enable SQL Server if you choose. Creating a console app for exploring LINQ to Entities First, we must create a console app and Northwind database to work with: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a new Console App / console project named LinqWithEFCore to the Chapter11 solution. System.Console class. 2. In the project file, globally and statically import the LinqWithEFCore project, add a package reference to the EF Core provider for SQLite 3. In the and/or SQL Server, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <!--To use SQLite--> <PackageReference Version="8.0.0" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite" /> <!--To use SQL Server--> <PackageReference Version="8.0.0" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" /> <PackageReference Version="5.1.1" Include="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" /> </ItemGroup> 4. Build the LinqWithEFCore project to restore packages. Northwind4Sqlite.sql file to the LinqWithEFCore folder. 5. Copy the At a command prompt or terminal in the LinqWithEFCore folder, create the Northwind database 6. by executing the following command: sqlite3 Northwind.db -init Northwind4Sqlite.sql 7. Be patient because this command might take a while to create the database structure. Eventually, you will see the SQLite command prompt, as shown in the following output: -- Loading resources from Northwind4Sqlite.sql SQLite version 3.38.0 2022-02-22 15:20:15 Enter ".help" for usage hints. sqlite>
