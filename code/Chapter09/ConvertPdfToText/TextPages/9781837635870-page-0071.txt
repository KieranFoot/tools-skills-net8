Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 52 Warning! Alpha versions are designed to be used only internally by Microsoft employees. Beta versions (official previews) are designed to be used externally and are publicized in Microsoft blog posts. Personally, I would not download an alpha of .NET 9 until December 2023 when it might have some new features compared to .NET 8. Once official previews of .NET 9 become available in February 2024, I recommend using those instead. For more about using .NET 9 or 10 with this book, please see the following link: https://github.com/ markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/dotnet9.md. Summary In this chapter, we: • Set up your development environment. Discussed the similarities and differences between modern .NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, • Xamarin, and .NET Standard in an online article. • Used Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code with the .NET SDK CLI to create a couple of simple console apps grouped in a solution. • Learned how to download the solution code for this book from its GitHub repository. • Learned how to find help. This could be in the traditional way, by using help command switch- es, documentation, and articles, or the modern way, by having a conversation with a coding expert AI, or using an AI-based tool to perform “grunt work.” In the next chapter, you will learn how to “speak” C#.
