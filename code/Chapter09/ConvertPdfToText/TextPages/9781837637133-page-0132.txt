Chapter 3 99 The output of your connection string will be different. Controlling the tracking of entities We need to start with the definition of entity identity resolution. EF Core resolves each entity instance by reading its unique primary key value. This ensures no ambiguities about the identities of entities or relationships between them. EF Core can only track entities with keys because it uses a key to uniquely identify the entity in the database. Keyless entities, like those returned by views, are never tracked. By default, EF Core assumes that you want to track entities in local memory so that if you make changes, like adding a new entity, modifying an existing entity, or removing an existing entity, then you can call SaveChanges and all those changes will be made in the underlying data store. If you execute a query within a data context, like getting all customers in Germany, and then execute another query within the same data context, like getting all customers whose name starts with A, if one of those customer entities already exists in the context, it will be identified and not replaced or loaded twice. However, if the telephone number of that customer is updated in the database between the executions of the two queries, then the entity being tracked in the data context is not refreshed with the new telephone number. If you do not need to track these changes, or you want to load new instances of an entity for every query execution with the latest data values, even if the entity is already loaded, then you can disable tracking. To disable tracking for an individual query, call the AsNoTracking method as part of the query, as shown in the following code: var products = db.Products .AsNoTracking() .Where(p => p.UnitPrice > price) .Select(p => new { p.ProductId, p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice }); To disable tracking by default for the data context, set the change trackerâ€™s query tracking behavior to NoTracking, as shown in the following code: db.ChangeTracker.QueryTrackingBehavior = QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking;
