Building Websites Using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages 694 Exercise 13.2 – Using Razor class libraries Everything related to a Razor Page can be compiled into a class library for easier reuse in multiple projects. I have written an online-only section showing how to build a Razor class library and use it in an ASP.NET Core project like Northwind.Web. You can read it at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch13-razor-library.md Exercise 13.3 – Enabling HTTP/3 and request decompression support HTTP/3 brings benefits to all internet-connected apps, but especially mobile. I have written an on- line-only section introducing HTTP/3 and showing how to enable it in an ASP.NET Core project like Northwind.Web when targeting .NET 7 or later. In previews of .NET 8, HTTP/3 was enabled by default, but the Microsoft team decided to revert to disabling HTTP/3 by default. They did this due to a bad experience caused by some anti-virus software. Hopefully in ASP.NET Core 9 they will resolve this issue and re-enable HTTP/3 by default. You can read more about their decision at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-8-rc-1/#http-3- disabled-by-default The page also includes a section about enabling request decompression support. You can read the page at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch13-enabling-http3.md Exercise 13.4 – Practice building a data-driven web page Add a Razor Page to the Northwind.Web website that enables the user to see a list of customers grouped by country. When the user clicks on a customer record, they should then see a page showing the full contact details of that customer and a list of their orders. My suggested solution can be found at the following links: • https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/code/PracticalApps/Northwind.

Web/Pages/CustomerOrders.cshtml.cs Exercise 13.5 – Practice building web pages for functions Reimplement some of the console apps from earlier chapters as Razor Pages; for example, from Chap- ter 4, Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions, provide a web user interface to output times tables, calculate tax, and generate factorials and the Fibonacci sequence.
