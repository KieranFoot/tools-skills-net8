Chapter 12 635 We will automatically generate some entity models using the EF Core command-line tool: 1. Use your preferred code editor to create a new project and solution, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Class Library / classlib • Project file and folder: Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite • Solution file and folder: PracticalApps 2. In the Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite project, add package references for the SQLite data- base provider and EF Core design-time support, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Version="8.0.0" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite" /> <PackageReference Version="8.0.0" Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design"> <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets> <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets> </PackageReference> </ItemGroup> 3. Delete the Class1.cs file. Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite project to restore packages. 4. Build the Northwind4Sqlite.sql file into the PracticalApps solution folder (not the project 5. Copy the folder!). PracticalApps folder, enter a command to create 6. At a command prompt or terminal in the Northwind.db file for SQLite, as shown in the following command: the sqlite3 Northwind.db -init Northwind4SQLite.sql Be patient because this command might take a while to create the database structure. 7. To exit SQLite command mode, press Ctrl + C twice on Windows or Cmd + D on macOS or Linux. 8. At a command prompt or terminal in the Northwind.EntityModels.Sqlite project folder (the folder that contains the .csproj project file), generate entity class models for all tables, as shown in the following command: dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Data Source=../Northwind.db" Microsoft. EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --namespace Northwind.EntityModels --data- annotations Note the following: • The command to perform: dbcontext scaffold • The connection string refers to the database file in the solution folder, which is one folder up from the current project folder: "Data Source=../Northwind.db"
