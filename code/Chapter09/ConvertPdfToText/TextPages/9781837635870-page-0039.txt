Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 20 All code examples and commands that the reader must review or type are shown in plain text so you will never have to read code or commands from a screenshot like in Figure 1.5, which might be too small or too faint in print. Compiling and running code using Visual Studio The next task is to compile and run the code: 1. In Visual Studio, navigate to Debug | Start Without Debugging. Good Practice: When you start a project in Visual Studio 2022, you can choose whether to attach a debugger or not. If you do not need to debug, then it is better not to attach one because attaching a debugger requires more resources and slows everything down. Attaching a debugger also limits you to only starting one project. If you want to run more than one project, each with a debugger attached, then you must start multiple instances of Visual Studio. In the toolbar, click the green outline triangle button (to the right of HelloCS in the top bar Figure 1.5) to start without debugging instead of the green solid triangle button (to the left of HelloCS in the top bar Figure 1.5), unless you need to debug. 2. The output in the console window will show the result of running your application, as shown in Figure 1.6: Figure 1.6: Running the console app on Windows 3. Press any key to close the console app window and return to Visual Studio. 4. Optionally, close the Properties pane to make more vertical space for Solution Explorer. Double-click the HelloCS project and note the HelloCS.csproj project file shows that this 5. project has its target framework set to net8.0, as shown in Figure 1.7.
