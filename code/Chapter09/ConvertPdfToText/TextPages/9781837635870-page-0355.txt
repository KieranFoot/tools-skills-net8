Implementing Interfaces and Inheriting Classes 336 9. Note that the generic value type, Nullable<T>, must have a type T, which is a struct, aka a value type, and it has useful members like HasValue, Value, and GetValueOrDefault, as shown in Figure 6.2: Figure 6.2: Revealing Nullable<T> members Good Practice: When you append a ? after a struct type, you change it to a different type. For example, DateTime? becomes Nullable<DateTime>. Understanding null-related initialisms Before we see some code, letâ€™s review some commonly used initialisms in Table 6.3: Initialism Meaning Description NRT Nullable Reference Type A compiler feature introduced with C# 8 and enabled by default in new projects with C# 10, which performs static analysis of your code at design time and shows warnings of potential misuse of null values for reference types. NullReferenceException NRE An exception thrown at runtime when dereferencing a null value, aka accessing a variable or member on an object that is null. ArgumentNullException ANE An exception thrown at runtime by a method, property, or indexer invocation when an argument or value is null, and when the business logic determines that it is not valid.
