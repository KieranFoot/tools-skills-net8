Implementing Interfaces and Inheriting Classes 294 Setting up a class library and console application We will start by defining a solution with two projects, like the one created in Chapter 5, Building Your Own Types with Object-Oriented Programming. Even if you completed all the exercises in that chapter, follow the instructions below so that you start this chapter with fresh working projects: 1. Use your preferred coding tool to create a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Class Library / classlib • Project file and folder: PacktLibrary • Solution file and folder: Chapter06 • Framework: .NET 8.0 (Long-Term Support) 2. Add a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: Console App / console • Project file and folder: PeopleApp • Solution file and folder: Chapter06 • Framework: .NET 8.0 (Long-Term Support) • Do not use top-level statements: Cleared. • Enable native AOT publish: Cleared. In this chapter, both projects target .NET 8 and, therefore, use the C# 12 compiler by default. PacktLibrary project, rename the file named Class1.cs to Person.cs. 3. In the <ItemGroup> to globally and statically import the System.Console class, 4. In both projects, add as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" /> </ItemGroup> 5. In Person.cs, delete any existing statements and define a Person class, as shown in the fol- lowing code: namespace Packt.Shared; public class Person { #region Properties public string? Name { get; set; }
