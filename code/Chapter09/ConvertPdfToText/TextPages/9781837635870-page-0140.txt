Chapter 3 121 Remember that ,-5 means left-align within a five-width column. 2. Run the code and note the results, as shown in the following output: AND | p | q p | True | False q | False | False OR | p | q p | True | True q | True | False XOR | p | q p | False | True q | True | False For the AND & logical operator, both operands must be true for the result to be true. For the OR | logical operator, either operand can be true for the result to be true. For the XOR ^ logical operator, true (but not both!) for the result to be true. either operand can be Exploring conditional logical operators Conditional logical operators are like logical operators, but you use two symbols instead of one, for example, && instead of &, or || instead of |. In Chapter 4, Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions, you will learn about functions in more detail, but I need to introduce functions now to explain conditional logical operators, also known as short-cir- cuiting Boolean operators. A function executes statements and then returns a value. That value could be a Boolean value like true that is used in a Boolean operation. Letâ€™s make use of conditional logical operators: 1. At the bottom of Program.cs, write statements to declare a function that writes a message to the console and returns true, as shown in the following code: static bool DoStuff() { WriteLine("I am doing some stuff."); return true; }
