Speaking C# 62 Code editors like Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code provide a handy feature to collapse and expand blocks by toggling the [-] or [+] or an arrow symbol pointing down or right when you move your mouse cursor over the left margin of the code, as shown in Figure 2.2: Figure 2.2: Code editors with expanded and collapsed blocks Regions You can define your own labeled regions around any statements you want and then most code editors will allow you to collapse and expand them in the same way as blocks, as shown in the following code: #region Three variables that store the number 2 million. int decimalNotation = 2_000_000; int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_1000_0100_1000_0000; int hexadecimalNotation = 0x_001E_8480; #endregion In this way, regions can be treated as commented blocks that can be collapsed to show a summary of what the block does. I will use #region blocks throughout the solution code in the GitHub repository, especially for the early chapters before we start defining functions that act as natural collapsible regions, but I won’t show them in the print book, to save space. Use your own judgment to decide if you want to use regions in your own code. Examples of statements and blocks In a simple console app that does not use the top-level program feature, I’ve added some comments to the statements and blocks, as shown in the following code: using System; // A semicolon indicates the end of a statement. namespace Basics
