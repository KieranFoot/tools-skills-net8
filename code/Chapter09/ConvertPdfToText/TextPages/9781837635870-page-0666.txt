Chapter 12 647 Product? product = db.Products.Find(keyValues: 1); string actual = product?.ProductName ?? string.Empty; Assert.Equal(expected, actual); } } } 6. Run the unit tests: • If you are using Visual Studio 2022, then navigate to Test | Run All Tests, and then view the results in Test Explorer. Northwind.UnitTests project’s TER- • If you are using Visual Studio Code, then in the MINAL window, run the tests, as shown in the following command: dotnet test. Alternatively, use the TESTING window if you have installed C# Dev Kit. 7. Note that the results should indicate that three tests ran, and all passed. If any of the tests fail, then fix the issue. For example, if you are using SQLite, then check that the Northwind.db file is in the solution directory (one up from the project directories). Check the database path in northwindlog.txt file on your desktop, which should output the database path it used the three times for the three tests, as shown in the following log: Database path: C:\cs12dotnet8\PracticalApps\Northwind.db Database path: C:\cs12dotnet8\PracticalApps\Northwind.db dbug: 18/09/2023 14:20:16.712 RelationalEventId.CommandExecuting[20100] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command) Executing DbCommand [Parameters=[@__p_0='?'
