Chapter 5 289 6. In Headset.cs, add a default parameterless constructor, as highlighted in the following code: namespace Packt.Shared; public class Headset(string manufacturer, string productName) { public string Manufacturer { get; set; } = manufacturer; public string ProductName { get; set; } = productName; // Default parameterless constructor calls the primary constructor. public Headset() : this("Microsoft", "HoloLens") { } } 7. In Program.cs, create an uninitialized instance of a headset and an instance for Meta Quest 3, as shown in the following code: Headset holo = new(); WriteLine($"{holo.ProductName} is made by {holo.Manufacturer}."); Headset mq = new() { Manufacturer = "Meta", ProductName = "Quest 3" }; WriteLine($"{mq.ProductName} is made by {mq.Manufacturer}."); 8. Run the PeopleApp project and view the results, as shown in the following output: Vision Pro is made by Apple. HoloLens is made by Microsoft. Quest 3 is made by Meta.
