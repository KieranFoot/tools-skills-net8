Chapter 14 645 In the next few sections, we will review some of the more common Tag Helpers: • Anchor Tag Helper • Cache Tag Helper • Environment Tag Helper • Image Tag Helper • Forms-related Tag Helpers Exploring the Anchor Tag Helper First, we will create three clickable hyperlinks styled as buttons to view the home page with all orders, the orders for a single customer, and the orders in a single country. This will allow us to see the basics of creating links to controllers and actions, as well as passing parameters using a route parameter and arbitrary query string parameters. Let’s explore these examples of the Anchor Tag Helper: 1. In the Views folder, in _ViewImports.cshtml, note the @addTagHelper directive, which adds the ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers, as shown highlighted in the following code: @using Northwind.Mvc @using Northwind.Mvc.Models @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers @using Northwind.EntityModels You could create your own Tag Helpers and you would have to register them in the same way. But that is beyond the scope of this book. If you want to learn how, you can read the following documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/ en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/authoring. 2. In the Views/Home folder, in Privacy.cshtml, add markup to define a paragraph with clickable hyperlinks styled as buttons using the <a> tag, as shown in the following markup: <p> <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">Orders</a> <a asp-controller="Home" class="btn btn-outline-primary" role="button">This Page</a> <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index" asp-route-id="ALFKI" class="btn btn-outline-primary" role="button"> Orders for Alfreds Futterkiste</a>
