Chapter 2 63 Data Source=tcp:apps-services-book.database.windows. net,1433;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=markjprice;Password=123456;Multiple Active Result Sets=True;Connect Timeout=10;Encrypt=True;Trust Server Certificate=True Opening connection. Please wait up to 10 seconds... SQL exception: Login failed for user 'markjprice'. 10. In Program.cs, change the server name (the DataSource property) to something wrong. 11. Run the console app and note the result (depending on where your database is hosted, the exception message might be slightly different), as shown in the following output: SQL exception: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - No such host is known.) When opening a SQL Server connection, the default timeout is 30 seconds for server con- nection problems, so be patient! We changed the timeout to 10 seconds to avoid having to wait so long. Executing queries and working with data readers using ADO.NET Now that we have a successful connection to the SQL Server database, we can run commands that retrieve rows from a table and process the results using a data reader: 1. In Program.cs, import the namespace for working with ADO.NET command types, as shown in the following code: using System.Data; // To use CommandType. Good Practice: To save space in this book, I will use the names cmd and r to repre- sent an SQL command and an SQL data reader. In your code, give variables proper word names like command and reader.
