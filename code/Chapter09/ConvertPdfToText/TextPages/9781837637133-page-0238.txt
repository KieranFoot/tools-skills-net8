6 Using Popular Third-Party Libraries This chapter is about some popular third-party libraries for .NET that enable you to perform actions that either are not possible with the core .NET libraries or are better than the built-in functionality. These actions include manipulating images with ImageSharp, logging with Serilog, mapping objects to other objects with AutoMapper, making unit test assertions with FluentAssertions, validating data with FluentValidation, and generating PDFs with QuestPDF. This chapter covers the following topics: • Which third-party libraries are most popular? • Working with images • Logging with Serilog • Mapping between objects • Making fluent assertions in unit testing • Validating data • Generating PDFs Which third-party libraries are most popular? To help me decide which third-party libraries to include in this book, I researched which are download- ed most frequently at https://www.nuget.org/stats/packages, and, as shown in Table 6.1, they are: Rank Package Downloads newtonsoft.json 1 167,927,712 serilog 2 42,436,567 awssdk.core 3 36,423,449 castle.core 4 28,383,411 newtonsoft.json.bson 5 26,547,661 swashbuckle.aspnetcore.swagger 6 25,828,940
