Epilogue I wanted this book to be different from the others on the market. I hope that you found it to be a brisk, fun read, packed with practical, hands-on walkthroughs of each subject. This epilogue contains the following short sections: • Cloud-native development using .NET Aspire • Introducing the Survey Project Challenge • Third edition coming in December 2025 • Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey • Good luck! Cloud-native development using .NET Aspire In this book you have seen lots of technologies that are used to build cloud-native applications, like gRPC for efficient communication between services, caching of various types, and fault tolerance using Polly. As you implement more and more of these technologies, managing your development environment gets harder and harder. Connection strings, secret keys, port numbers, rate limiting, and caching configurations: if any are wrong, things break, or work in unexpected ways, and it can be hard to identify and then fix the issue. At .NET Conf 2023 on November 14, 2023, the .NET team announced a new product: .NET Aspire. It is currently available in preview and the team plan to release version 1.0 in the spring of 2024. If you want to try out the preview, then when installing Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview 1 or later, make sure to select .NET Aspire SDK (Preview) under the Individual components tab. As stated in the official announcement blog article, .NET Aspire “is an opinionated stack for building resilient, observable, and configurable cloud-native applications with .NET.” It provides the following: • Aspire components: Based on existing mature technologies like Redis and OpenTelemetry, but wrapped in Aspire-specific packages that provide quick and easy configuration, Aspire components provide standardized functionality including service discovery, telemetry, resil- ience, and health checks.
