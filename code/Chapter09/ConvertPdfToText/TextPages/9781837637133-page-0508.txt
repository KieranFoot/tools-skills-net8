11 Broadcasting Real-Time Communication Using SignalR In this chapter, you will be introduced to SignalR, a technology that enables a developer to create a service that can have multiple clients and broadcast messages to all of them or a subset of them live in real time. The canonical example is a group chat app. Other examples include notification systems and dashboards that need instantly up-to-date information like stock prices. This chapter will cover the following topics: • Understanding SignalR • Building a live communication service using SignalR • Building a web client using the SignalR JavaScript library • Building a .NET console app client • Streaming data using SignalR Understanding SignalR To understand the problem that SignalR solves, we need to understand what web development is like without it. The foundation of the web is HTTP, which for more than 30 years has been great for building general-purpose websites and services. However, the web was not designed for specialized scenarios that require a web page to be instantaneously updated with new information as it becomes available. The history of real-time communication on the web To understand the benefits of SignalR, it helps to know the history of HTTP and how organizations worked to make it better for real-time communication between clients and servers. In the early days of the Web in the 1990s, browsers had to make a full-page HTTP GET request to the web server to get fresh information to show to the visitor.
