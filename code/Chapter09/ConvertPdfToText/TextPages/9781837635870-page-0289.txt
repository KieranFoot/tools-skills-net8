Building Your Own Types with Object-Oriented Programming 270 You do not explicitly call the Deconstruct method. It is called implicitly when you assign an object to a tuple variable. 3. Run the PeopleApp project and view the result, as shown in the following output: Deconstructed person: Bob Smith, 12/22/1965 4:28:00 PM -05:00 Deconstructed person: Bob Smith, 12/22/1965 4:28:00 PM -05:00, StatueOfZeusAtOlympia Implementing functionality using local functions A language feature introduced in C# 7 is the ability to define a local function. Local functions are the method equivalent of local variables. In other words, they are methods that are only accessible from within the containing method in which they have been defined. In other languages, they are sometimes called nested or inner functions. Local functions can be defined anywhere inside a method: the top, the bottom, or even somewhere in the middle! We will use a local function to implement a factorial calculation: 1. In Person.cs, add statements to define a Factorial function that uses a local function inside itself to calculate the result, as shown in the following code: // Method with a local function. public static int Factorial(int number) { if (number < 0) { throw new ArgumentException( $"{nameof(number)} cannot be less than zero."); } return localFactorial(number); int localFactorial(int localNumber) // Local function. { if (localNumber == 0) return 1; return localNumber * localFactorial(localNumber - 1); } }
