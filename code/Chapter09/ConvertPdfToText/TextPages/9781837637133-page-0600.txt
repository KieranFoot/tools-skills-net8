13 Building Efficient Microservices Using gRPC In this chapter, you will be introduced to gRPC, which enables a developer to build services that can communicate highly efficiently across most platforms. However, web browsers do not have full support for programmatic access to all features of HTTP/2, which is required by gRPC. This makes gRPC most useful for implementing intermediate tier-to-tier services and microservices because they must perform a lot of communication between multiple microservices to achieve a complete task. Improving the efficiency of that communication is vital to the success of the scalability and performance of microservices. A modular monolithic, two-tier, client-to-service style service is inherently more efficient because the communication between modules is in-process and there is only one layer of network communication between the whole service and the clients. Microservice architecture has more tiers, and therefore more layers of network communication between the many microservices. It becomes more important to have highly efficient communica- tion between those layers, and gRPC is designed to be ultra-efficient for network communication, as shown in Figure 13.1:
