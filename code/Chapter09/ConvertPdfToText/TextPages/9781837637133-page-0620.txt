Chapter 13 587 3. In the Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc project file, modify or add the entry to register the .proto file as being used on the client side, as shown highlighted in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <Protobuf Include="Protos\greet.proto" GrpcServices="Client" /> <Protobuf Include="Protos\shipper.proto" GrpcServices="Client" /> </ItemGroup> If you are using a code editor like JetBrains Rider that adds extra configuration, I recommend that you simplify the elements as shown in the preceding markup. If you do not, then you might get errors later in this coding task. 4. In the Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc project file, in Program.cs, add a statement to register the ShipperClient class to connect to the gRPC service listening on port 5131, as shown in the following code: builder.Services.AddGrpcClient<Shipper.ShipperClient>("Shipper", options => { options.Address = new Uri("https://localhost:5131"); }); 5. In the Models folder, in HomeIndexViewModel.cs, add a property to store a summary of a shipper, as shown in the following code: public string? ShipperSummary { get; set; } 6. In the Controllers folder, in HomeController.cs, declare a field to store a shipper client instance and set it by using the client factory in the constructor, as shown highlighted in the following code: public class HomeController : Controller { private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger; private readonly Greeter.GreeterClient _greeterClient; private readonly Shipper.ShipperClient _shipperClient; public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger, GrpcClientFactory factory) { _logger = logger; _greeterClient = factory.CreateClient<Greeter. GreeterClient>("Greeter");
