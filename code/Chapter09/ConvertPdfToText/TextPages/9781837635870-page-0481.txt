Working with Common .NET Types 462 Exercise 8.3 – Practice writing extension methods In the Chapter08 solution, create a class library named Ch08Ex03NumbersAsWordsLib and projects to test it. It should define extension methods that extend number types such as BigInteger and int with a method named ToWords that returns a string describing the number. For example, 18,000,000 would be eighteen million, and 18,456,002,032,011,000,007 would be eighteen quintillion, four hundred and fifty-six quadrillion, two trillion, thirty-two billion, eleven million, and seven.

Exercise 8.4 – Working with network resources If you are interested in some low-level types for working with network resources, then you can read an online-only section found at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch08-network-resources.md Exercise 8.5 – Explore topics Use the links on the following page to learn more details about the topics covered in this chapter: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/book-links.md#chapter-8--- working-with-common-net-types Summary In this chapter, you explored: • Choices for types to store and manipulate numbers. • Handling text, including using regular expressions for validating input. • Collections to use for storing multiple items. • Working with indexes, ranges, and spans. In the next chapter, we will manage files and streams, encode and decode text, and perform serial- ization.
