Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 32 Figure 1.13: Running a console app in Visual Studio Code with two projects Once you open multiple terminal windows, you can toggle between them by clicking their names in the panel on the right-hand side of TERMINAL. By default, the name will be one of the common shells like pwsh, powershell, zsh, or bash. Right-click and choose Rename to set something else. When using Visual Studio Code, or more accurately, the dotnet CLI, to run a console app, it executes the app from the <projectname> folder. When using Visual Studio 2022 for Windows, it executes the app from the <projectname>\bin\Debug\net8.0 folder. It will be important to remember this when we work with the filesystem in later chapters. If you were to run the program on macOS Ventura, the environment operating system would be dif- ferent, as shown in the following output: Unix 13.5.2 Good Practice: Although the source code, like the .csproj and .cs files, is identical, the bin and obj folders that are automatically generated by the compiler could have mis- matches that give you errors. If you want to open the same project in both Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code, delete the temporary bin and obj folders before opening the project in the other code editor. This potential problem is why I asked you to create a different folder for the Visual Studio Code projects in this chapter.
