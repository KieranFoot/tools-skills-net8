Chapter 7 397 10. In ILSpy, in the Assemblies navigation tree on the left, expand { } and then expand Program. Select <Main>$(string[]) : void to show the statements in the compiler-generated Program class 11. and its <Main>$ method, as shown in Figure 7.4: Figure 7.4: Revealing the <Main>$ method using ILSpy 12. In ILSpy, navigate to File | Openâ€¦. 13. Navigate to the following folder: cs12dotnet8/Chapter07/DotNetEverywhere/bin/Release/net8.0/linux-x64 14. Select the System.Linq.dll assembly and click Open. 15. In the Assemblies tree, expand the System.Linq (8.0.0.0, .NETCoreApp, v8.0) assembly, ex- pand the System.Linq namespace, expand the Enumerable class, and then click the Count<T- Source>(this IEnumerable<TSource>) : int method. Count method, note the good practice of checking the source parameter and throwing 16.
