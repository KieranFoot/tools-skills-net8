3 Controlling Flow, Converting Types, and Handling Exceptions This chapter is all about writing code that performs simple operations on variables, makes decisions, performs pattern matching, and repeats statements or blocks. You will also learn how to work with arrays to store multiple values, how to convert variable or expression values from one type to another, how to handle exceptions, and how to check for overflows in number variables. This chapter covers the following topics: • Operating on variables • Understanding selection statements • Understanding iteration statements • Storing multiple values in an array • Casting and converting between types • Handling exceptions • Checking for overflow Operating on variables Operators apply simple operations such as addition and multiplication to operands such as variables and literal values. Operators return a new value that is the result of the operation and can be assigned to a variable, and they can also affect the operands. Understanding binary operators Most operators are binary, meaning that they work on two operands, as shown in the following pseudocode: var resultOfOperation = firstOperand operator secondOperand;
