Chapter 12 507 As ChilliCream says on its home page, “We at ChilliCream build the ultimate GraphQL platform. Most of our code is open-source and will forever remain open-source.” The GitHub repository for Hot Chocolate is at the following link: https://github.com/ ChilliCream/hotchocolate. Building a service that supports GraphQL There is no dotnet new project template for GraphQL, so we will use the ASP.NET Core Empty project template. Even though GraphQL does not have to be hosted on a web server because it is not tied to HTTP, it is a sensible choice to get started. We will then add a package reference for GraphQL support: 1. Use your preferred code editor to add a new project, as defined in the following list: • Project template: ASP.NET Core Empty / web • Solution file and folder: Chapter12 • Project file and folder: Northwind.GraphQL.Service • Other Visual Studio 2022 options: • Configure for HTTPS: Selected • Enable Docker: Cleared • Do not use top-level statements: Cleared In the project file, add a package reference for Hot Chocolate hosted in ASP.NET Core, as 2. shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="HotChocolate.AspNetCore" Version="13.5.1" /> </ItemGroup> Version 13.6.0 was in preview at the time of writing. To use the most recent preview version, you can set it to 13.6-*. But I recommend that you go to the following link and then reference the latest GA version: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ HotChocolate.AspNetCore/. 3. In the project file, treat warnings as errors and disable the warning AD0001, as highlighted in the following markup: <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> <NoWarn>AD0001</NoWarn> </PropertyGroup>
