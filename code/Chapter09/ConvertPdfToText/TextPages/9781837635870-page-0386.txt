7 Packaging and Distributing .NET Types This chapter is about how C# keywords are related to .NET types, and about the relationship between namespaces and assemblies. You’ll become familiar with how to package and publish your .NET apps and libraries for cross-platform use. We also cover how to decompile .NET assemblies for learning purposes and why you cannot prevent others from decompiling your code. In an online-only section, Exercise 7.3 – Porting from .NET Framework to modern .NET, you can learn how to use legacy .NET Framework libraries in .NET libraries and how it is possible to port legacy .NET Framework code bases to modern .NET. In another online-only section, Exercise 7.4 – Creating source generators, you will learn how to create source generators that can dynamically add source code to your projects, a very powerful feature. This chapter covers the following topics: • The road to .NET 8 • Understanding .NET components • Publishing your applications for deployment • Native ahead-of-time compilation • Decompiling .NET assemblies • Packaging your libraries for NuGet distribution • Working with preview features The road to .NET 8 This part of the book is about the functionality in the Base Class Library (BCL) APIs provided by .NET and how to reuse functionality across all the different .NET platforms using .NET Standard.
