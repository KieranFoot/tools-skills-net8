Building Websites Using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages 674 There are two useful dictionaries that you can write to and read from: • ViewData: This dictionary exists during the lifetime of a single HTTP request. A component of the website, like a controller or a specific page, can store some data in it that can then be read by another component of the website, like a view or a shared layout, that executes later in that same request process. It is named ViewData because it is mostly used to store information that will later be needed for rendering in a Razor page or view. TempData: This dictionary exists during the lifetime of an HTTP request and the next HTTP request • from the same browser. This allows a part of the website, like a controller, to store some data in it, respond to the browser with a redirect, and then another part of the website can read the data on the second request. Only the browser that made the original request can access this data. For example, a typical ViewData scenario is shown in Figure 13.6 and includes the following steps: 1. A browser makes a request for a page like the home page. ViewData dictionary. (You 2.
