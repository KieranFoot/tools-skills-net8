Chapter 5 237 • Methods are used to execute statements. You saw some examples when you learned about functions in Chapter 4, Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions. There are also four specialized categories of methods: • Constructor: The statements execute when you use the new keyword to allocate memory to instantiate a class. For example, to instantiate Christmas Day 2023, you could write the following code: new DateTime(2023, 12, 25). Property: The statements execute when you get or set data. The data is commonly • stored in a field but can be stored externally or calculated at runtime. Properties are the preferred way to encapsulate fields unless the memory address of the field needs to be exposed, for example, Console.ForegroundColor to set the current color of text in a console app. []. For • Indexer: The statements execute when you get or set data using “array” syntax name[0] to get the first character in the name variable, which is a string. example, use Operator: The statements execute when you apply an operator like + and / to operands • of your type. For example, use a + b to add two variables together. Importing a namespace to use a type In this section, we will make an instance of the Person class. Before we can instantiate a class, we need to reference the assembly that contains it from another project. We will use the class in a console app: 1. Use your preferred coding tool to add a new Console App / console named PeopleApp to the Chapter05 solution. Make sure you add the new project to the existing Chapter05 solution because you are about to reference from the console app project to the existing class library project so both projects must be in the same solution. 2. If you use Visual Studio 2022: 1. Configure the startup project for the solution to the current selection. PeopleApp project, navigate to Project | Add Project 2. In Solution Explorer, select the Reference…, check the box to select the PacktLibraryNetStandard2 project, and then click OK. PeopleApp.csproj, add an entry to statically import the System.Console class, as 3. In shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" /> </ItemGroup> 4. Navigate to Build | Build PeopleApp.
