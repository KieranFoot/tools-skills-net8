Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 2 After navigating to the GitHub repository in your web browser, press the . (dot) key on your keyboard, or manually change .com to .dev in the link to convert the repository into a live code editor based on Visual Studio Code using GitHub Codespaces, as shown in Figure 1.1: Figure 1.1: GitHub Codespaces live editing the book’s GitHub repository We provide you with a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots and diagrams used in this book. You can download this file from https://packt.link/gbp/9781837635870. Visual Studio Code in a web browser is great to run alongside your chosen local code editor as you work through the book’s coding tasks. You can compare your code to the solution code and easily copy and paste parts if needed. You do not need to use or know anything about Git to get the solution code of this book. You can download a ZIP file containing all the code solutions by using the following di- rect link and then extract the ZIP file into your local filesystem: https://github.com/ markjprice/cs12dotnet8/archive/refs/heads/main.zip. .NET terms used in this book Throughout this book, I use the term modern .NET to refer to .NET 8 and its predecessors like .NET 6 that derive from .NET Core. I use the term legacy .NET to refer to .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard. Modern .NET is a unification of those legacy platforms and standards. The structure and style of this book After this first chapter, the book can be divided into three parts: language, libraries, and web devel- opment.
