Speaking C# 102 Simplifying the usage of the console In C# 6 and later, the using statement can be used not only to import a namespace but also to further simplify our code by importing a static class. Then, we won’t need to enter the Console type name throughout our code. Importing a static type for a single file You can use your code editor’s Find and Replace feature to remove the times we have previously written Console: 1. At the top of the Program.cs file, add a statement to statically import the System.Console class, as shown in the following code: using static System.Console; 2. Select the first Console. in your code, ensuring that you select the dot after the word Console too. 3. In Visual Studio 2022, navigate to Edit | Find and Replace | Quick Replace; in Visual Studio Code, navigate to Edit | Replace; or in JetBrains Rider, navigate to Edit | Find | Replace, and note that an overlay dialog appears ready for you to enter what you would like to replace Console. with, as shown in Figure 2.9: Figure 2.9: Using the Replace feature in Visual Studio to simplify your code 4. Leave the Replace box empty, click on the Replace all button (the second of the two buttons to the right of the replace box), and then close the replace box by clicking on the cross in its top-right corner. 5. Run the console app and note the behavior is the same as before. Importing a static type for all code files in a project Instead of statically importing the Console class just for one code file, it would probably be better to import it globally for all code files in the project: 1. Delete the statement to statically import System.Console. Open Formatting.csproj, and after the <PropertyGroup> section, add a new <ItemGroup> 2. section to globally and statically import System.Console using the implicit using .NET SDK feature, as shown in the following markup:
