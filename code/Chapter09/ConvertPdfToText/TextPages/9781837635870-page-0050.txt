Chapter 1 31 Adding a second project using Visual Studio Code Letâ€™s add a second project to explore how to work with multiple projects: 1. In TERMINAL, change to the Chapter01-vscode directory, as shown in the following command: cd .. 2. In TERMINAL, enter the command to create a new console app project named AboutMyEnvironment using the older non-top-level program style, as shown in the following command: dotnet new console -o AboutMyEnvironment --use-program-main Good Practice: Be careful when entering commands in TERMINAL. Be sure that you are in the correct folder before entering potentially destructive commands! 3. In TERMINAL, use the dotnet CLI to add the new project folder to the solution, as shown in the following command: dotnet sln add AboutMyEnvironment 4. Note the results, as shown in the following output: Project `AboutMyEnvironment\AboutMyEnvironment.csproj` added to the solution. 5. In SOLUTION EXPLORER, in the AboutMyEnvironment project, open Program.cs, and then in Main method, change the existing statement to output the current directory, the operating the system version string, and the namespace of the Program class, as shown in the following code: Console.WriteLine(Environment.CurrentDirectory); Console.WriteLine(Environment.OSVersion.VersionString); Console.WriteLine("Namespace: {0}", typeof(Program).Namespace); 6. In SOLUTION EXPLORER, right-click on any file in the AboutMyEnvironment project and choose Open In Integrated Terminal. 7. In TERMINAL, enter the command to run the project, as shown in the following command: dotnet run. Note the output in the TERMINAL window, as shown in the following output and in Figure 1.13: 8. C:\cs12dotnet8\Chapter01-vscode\AboutMyEnvironment Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.22621.0 Namespace: AboutMyEnvironment
