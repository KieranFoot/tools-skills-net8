Chapter 13 571 Type Description string Text values. Defaults to an empty string. bool Boolean values. Defaults to false. int32, int64 Variable length encoded 32- and 64-bit integer values. Although they can be used for negative values, it is more efficient to use sint32 or sint64. The C# equivalents to int and long. sint32, sint64, uint32, Variable length encoded 32- and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer values. uint64 The C# equivalent to int and long, and uint and ulong. fixed32, fixed64, Always four bytes for 32, or eight bytes for 64. The C# equivalent to uint sfixed32, sfixed64 and ulong, and int and long. float, double Floating point real numbers. 32 bytes Maximum 2 bytes (4,294,967,296). Use ByteString.CopyFrom(byte[] data) to create a new instance. Use ToByteArray() to get the byte array. Defaults to an empty ByteString value. Table 13.1: Number and other field data types in Protobuf More Information: The official guide is found at the following link: https://protobuf. dev/programming-guides/proto3/. gRPC benefits gRPC minimizes network usage by using Protobuf binary serialization that is not human-readable, unlike JSON or XML used by web services. gRPC requires HTTP/2, which provides significant performance benefits over earlier versions, like binary framing and compression, and multiplexing of HTTP/2 calls over a single connection. Binary framing means how the HTTP messages are transferred between the client and server. HTTP/1.x uses newline delimited plaintext. HTTP/2 splits communication into smaller messages (frames) that are encoded in binary format. Multiplexing means combining multiple messages from different sources into a single message to more efficiently use a shared resource like a network transport. More Information: If you are interested in more details about HTTP/2 and how it makes gRPC more efficient, you can read about it at the following link: https://grpc.io/blog/ grpc-on-http2/.
