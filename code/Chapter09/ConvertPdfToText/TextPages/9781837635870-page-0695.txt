Building Websites Using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages 676 2. In Suppliers.cshtml.cs, add statements to define a property to store a list of supplier com- pany names and populate it when an HTTP GET request for this page is made, as shown in the following code: using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages; // To use PageModel. namespace Northwind.Web.Pages; public class SuppliersModel : PageModel { public IEnumerable<string>? Suppliers { get; set; } public void OnGet() { ViewData["Title"] = "Northwind B2B - Suppliers"; Suppliers = new[] { "Alpha Co", "Beta Limited", "Gamma Corp" }; } } Warning! If you are using JetBrains Rider, then it names the class Suppliers. I recommend that you rename it SuppliersModel. While reviewing the preceding markup, note the following: • SuppliersModel inherits from PageModel, so it has members such as the ViewData dictionary for sharing data. You can right-click on PageModel and select Go To Defini- tion to see that it has lots more useful features, such as the entire HttpContext of the current request. SuppliersModel defines a property for storing a collection of string values named • Suppliers. GET request is made for this Razor Page, the OnGet method executes • When an HTTP and the Suppliers property is populated with some example supplier names from an array of string values. Later, we will populate this from the Northwind database.
