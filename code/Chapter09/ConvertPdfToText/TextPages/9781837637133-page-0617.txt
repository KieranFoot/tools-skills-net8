Building Efficient Microservices Using gRPC 584 We will start with the Shippers table because it is simple. Each shipper only has three properties, an int and two string values, and there are only three records in the table. Letâ€™s go: 1. In the Northwind.Grpc.Service project, add a project reference to the Northwind database context project, as shown in the following markup: <ItemGroup> <ProjectReference Include="..\..\Chapter03\Northwind.Common.DataContext .SqlServer\Northwind.Common.DataContext.SqlServer.csproj" /> </ItemGroup> The Include path must not have a line break. 2. At the command prompt or terminal, build the Northwind.Grpc.Service project, as shown in the following command: dotnet build. In the Northwind.Grpc.Service project, in the Protos folder, add a new file (the item template 3. is named Protocol Buffer File in Visual Studio 2022) named shipper.proto, as shown in the following code: syntax = "proto3"; option csharp_namespace = "Northwind.Grpc.Service"; package shipper; service Shipper { rpc GetShipper (ShipperRequest) returns (ShipperReply); } message ShipperRequest { int32 shipper_id = 1; } message ShipperReply { int32 shipper_id = 1; string company_name = 2; string phone = 3; }
