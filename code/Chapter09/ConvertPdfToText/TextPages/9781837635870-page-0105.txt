Speaking C# 86 Good Practice: Never compare double values using ==. During the First Gulf War, an American Patriot missile battery used double values in its calculations. The inaccuracy caused it to fail to track and intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile, and 28 soldiers were killed; you can read about this at https://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ patriot.html. The Patriot missile system has improved since then. “Forty years after it was brought into service, the Patriot air-defense system is finally doing what it was designed for.” “No one was 100% sure that the Patriot was capable of destroying a Kh-47 hypersonic missile,” said Col. Serhiy Yaremenko, commander of the 96th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, which defends Kyiv. “Ukrainians proved it.”: https://archive.ph/2023.06.11-132200/https://www. wsj.com/amp/articles/u-s-patriot-missile-is-an-unsung-hero-of-ukraine- war-db6053a0. Now let’s see the same code using the decimal number type: 1. Copy and paste the statements that you wrote before (which used the double variables). decimal and rename the variables to c and d, as shown in the 2. Modify the statements to use following code: Console.WriteLine("Using decimals:"); decimal c = 0.1M; // M suffix means a decimal literal value decimal d = 0.2M; if (c + d == 0.3M) { Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} equals {0.3M}"); } else { Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} does NOT equal {0.3M}"); } 3. Run the code and view the result, as shown in the following output: Using decimals: 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.3 The decimal type is accurate because it stores the number as a large integer and shifts the decimal point. For example, 0.1 is stored as 1, with a note to shift the decimal point one place to the left. 12.75 is stored as 1275, with a note to shift the decimal point two places to the left. Good Practice: Use int for whole numbers. Use double for real numbers that will not be compared for equality to other values; it is okay to compare double values being less than or greater than, and so on. Use decimal for money, CAD drawings, general engineering, and wherever the accuracy of a real number is important.
