Introducing Web Development Using ASP.NET Core 648 Understanding web development Developing for the web means developing with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), so we will start by reviewing this important foundational technology. Understanding the Hypertext Transfer Protocol To communicate with a web server, the client, also known as the user agent, makes calls over the network using HTTP. As such, HTTP is the technical underpinning of the web. So, when we talk about websites and web services, we mean that they use HTTP to communicate between a client (often a web browser) and a server. A client makes an HTTP request for a resource, such as a page, uniquely identified by a Uniform Re- source Locator (URL), and the server sends back an HTTP response, as shown in Figure 12.3: Figure 12.3: An HTTP request and response You can use Google Chrome and other browsers to record requests and responses. Good Practice: Google Chrome is currently used by about two-thirds of website visitors worldwide, and it has powerful, built-in developer tools, so it is a good first choice for testing your websites. Test your websites with Chrome and at least two other browsers, for example, Firefox and Safari for macOS and iPhone. Microsoft Edge switched from using Microsoft’s own rendering engine to using Chromium in 2019, so it is less important to test with it, although some say Edge has the best developer tools. If Microsoft’s Internet Explorer is used at all, it tends to mostly be inside organizations for intranets. Understanding the components of a URL A URL is made up of several components:
