Chapter 4 227 Letâ€™s see this in action with our call stack example: 1. In the CallStackExceptionHandling project, in Program.cs, in the Beta function, add a try- statement around the call to the Gamma function, as shown highlighted in the following catch code: void Beta() { WriteLine("In Beta"); try { Processor.Gamma(); } catch (Exception ex) { WriteLine($"Caught this: {ex.Message}"); throw ex; } } Note your code editor will show a squiggle under the throw ex to warn you that you will lose call stack information, as described in the following code analyzer message, Re-throwing caught exception changes stack information, with more details found at the following link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2200. 2. Run the console app and note that the output excludes some details of the call stack, as shown in the following output: Caught this: Could not find file 'C:\cs12dotnet8\Chapter04\ CallStackExceptionHandling\bin\Debug\net8.0\bad file path'. Unhandled exception. System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not find file 'C:\cs12dotnet8\Chapter04\CallStackExceptionHandling\bin\Debug\net8.0\bad file path'.
