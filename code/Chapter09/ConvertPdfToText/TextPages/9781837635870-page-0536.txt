Chapter 10 517 I decided to demonstrate databases using SQLite in this book, since important themes are cross-platform development and fundamental skills that only need basic database capabilities. I recommend that you initially complete the book code tasks using SQLite. If you also want to try the code tasks using SQL Server, then I provide documentation to do so in the online-only sections in the GitHub repository for this book. Using SQL Server or other SQL systems Enterprises that standardize on Windows tend to also use SQL Server as their database. If you would prefer to use SQL Server, please see the online instructions at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/sql-server/README.md If you would prefer to use a different SQL system, then the SQL scripts that I provide should work with most SQL systems, for example, PostgreSQL or MySQL, but I have not written step-by-step instructions for them and I make no guarantees they will work. My recommendation is to complete this book using SQLite, so you focus on learning what’s taught in the book about EF Core rather than adding the complication of trying to use a different database system. Learning is hard enough; don’t bite off more than you can chew, and don’t make it harder on yourself. Once you’ve learned what’s in the book, you can always repeat it with a different database system. Setting up SQLite for Windows On Windows, we need to add the folder for SQLite to the system path so it will be found when we enter commands at a command prompt or terminal: 1. Start your favorite browser and navigate to the following link: https://www.sqlite.org/ download.html. 2. Scroll down the page to the Precompiled Binaries for Windows section. 3. Click sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3420000.zip (or the file might have a higher version number), as shown in the following screenshot: Figure 10.2: Downloading SQLite for Windows
