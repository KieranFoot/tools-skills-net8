Chapter 9 467 Good Practice: Windows uses a backslash (\) for the directory separator character. macOS and Linux use a forward slash (/) for the directory separator character. Do not assume what character is used in your code when combining paths; use Path.DirectorySeparatorChar. In future sections of this chapter, we will create directories and files in the Personal special folder, so make a note of where that is for your operating system. For example, if you’re using Linux, it should $USER/Documents. be Managing drives To manage drives, use the DriveInfo type, which has a static method that returns information about all the drives connected to your computer. Each drive has a drive type. Let’s explore drives: 1. In Program.cs, write statements to get all the drives and output their name, type, size, available free space, and format, but only if the drive is ready, as shown in the following code: SectionTitle("Managing drives"); Table drives = new(); drives.AddColumn("[blue]NAME[/]"); drives.AddColumn("[blue]TYPE[/]"); drives.AddColumn("[blue]FORMAT[/]"); drives.AddColumn(new TableColumn( "[blue]SIZE (BYTES)[/]").RightAligned()); drives.AddColumn(new TableColumn( "[blue]FREE SPACE[/]").RightAligned()); foreach (DriveInfo drive in DriveInfo.GetDrives()) { if (drive.IsReady) { drives.AddRow(drive.Name, drive.DriveType.ToString(), drive.DriveFormat, drive.TotalSize.ToString("N0"), drive.AvailableFreeSpace.ToString("N0")); } else { drives.AddRow(drive.Name, drive.DriveType.ToString(), string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty);
