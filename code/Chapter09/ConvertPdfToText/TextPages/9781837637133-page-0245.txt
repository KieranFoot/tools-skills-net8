Working with text and numbers using Humanizer Humanizer manipulates text in string values, names of enum values, dates, times, numbers, and quantities. Working with text The built-in string type has methods to manipulate text like Substring and Trim. But there are plenty of other common manipulations that we might want to perform on text. For example: • You might have an ugly string generated by some code and you want to make it look friendlier to display to a user. This is common with enum types that cannot use spaces in multi-word values. • You might build a web content management system, and when a user enters an article title, you need to convert what they enter into a format suitable for a URL path. string value that needs to be truncated to show in the limited space of • You might have a long a mobile user interface. Humanizer case transformations Complex transformations can be performed in sequence by passing multiple Humanizer trans- formations to the Transform method. Transforms implement the IStringTransformer or ICulturedStringTransformer interfaces so you can implement your own custom transforms. The built-in transforms are all casing transformations, and they are listed in Table 6.2 along with convenient alternative methods that extend the string type: Transform Description Example To.LowerCase Transforms all characters in the string to the cat sat on the mat lowercase. To.UpperCase Transforms all characters in the string to THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT uppercase. To.TitleCase Transforms the first character of each word in The Cat Sat on the Mat the string to uppercase.
