Multitasking and Concurrency 196 The Northwind database has medium complexity and a decent number of sample records. You used it extensively in Chapter 2, Managing Relational Data Using SQL Server, where it was introduced and set up. Warning! You will only be able to complete this task if you have Microsoft Windows and the Northwind database stored in Microsoft SQL Server. This is the only section in this book that is not cross-platform and modern (WPF is 17 years old!). You can use either Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code. At this point, we are focusing on making a GUI app responsive. You will learn about XAML and building cross-platform GUI apps in Chapter 16, Building Mobile and Desktop Apps Using .NET MAUI. Since this book does not cover WPF elsewhere, I thought this task would be a good opportunity to at least see an example app built using WPF even if we do not look at it in detail. Letâ€™s go! 1. If you are using Visual Studio 2022, add a new WPF Application [C#] project named WpfResponsive to the Chapter05 solution. If you are using Visual Studio Code, use the following command: dotnet new wpf. If you are using JetBrains Rider, select Desktop Application and then select a Type of WPF Application. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the project. 2. Add a package reference for 3. In the project file, note the output type is a Windows EXE, the target framework is .NET for Windows (it will not run on other platforms, like macOS and Linux), and the project uses WPF, as shown in the following markup: <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"> <PropertyGroup> <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType> <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <UseWPF>true</UseWPF> </PropertyGroup> <ItemGroup> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Data.SqlClient" Version="5.2.0" /> </ItemGroup> </Project> 4. Build the WpfResponsive project to restore packages.
