Building User Interfaces Using Blazor 758 To ensure that the matching algorithm only performs matches on all of the text in the path, in other words, there is only a match when the whole complete text matches but not when just part of the path matches, then set the Match parameter to NavLinkMatch.All, as shown in the following code: <NavLink href="/customers" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">Customers</NavLink> If you set other attributes such as target, they are passed through to the underlying <a> element that is generated. Understanding base component classes The OnParametersSet method is defined by the base class that components inherit from by default named ComponentBase, as shown in the following code: using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components; public abstract class ComponentBase : IComponent, IHandleAfterRender, IHandleEvent { // Members not shown. } has some useful methods that you can call and override, as shown in Table 16.1: ComponentBase Method(s) Description Call this method to execute a function on the associated rendererâ€™s InvokeAsync synchronization context. OnAfterRender, Override these methods to invoke code after each time the component has been rendered. OnAfterRenderAsync OnInitialized, Override these methods to invoke code after the component has received its initial parameters from its parent in the render tree. OnInitializedAsync OnParametersSet, Override these methods to invoke code after the component has received parameters and the values have been assigned to properties. OnParametersSetAsync ShouldRender Override this method to indicate if the component should render. StateHasChanged Call this method to cause the component to re-render.
