Chapter 13 613 throw new RpcException(new Status(StatusCode.Unavailable, "Service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later.")); } } 2. Start the Northwind.Grpc.Service project without debugging. Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc project. 3. Start the 4. On the home page, note the exception, as shown in Figure 13.12: Figure 13.12: Service is unavailable exception 5. If you don’t get an exception, refresh the page until you do. 6. Close the browser and shut down the web servers. Now, let’s see how to add transient fault handling to the MVC website client: In the Northwind.Grpc.Client.Mvc project, in Program.cs, before adding the greeter client to 1. the services collection, add statements to define a MethodConfig with a retry policy that retries up to five times for status codes indicating an unavailable service, and then after configuring the greeter client address, apply the method config, as shown highlighted in the following code: MethodConfig configForAllMethods = new() { Names = { MethodName.Default }, RetryPolicy = new RetryPolicy { MaxAttempts = 5, InitialBackoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), MaxBackoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), BackoffMultiplier = 1.5, RetryableStatusCodes = { StatusCode.Unavailable } } }; builder.Services.AddGrpcClient<Greeter.GreeterClient>("Greeter", options => {
