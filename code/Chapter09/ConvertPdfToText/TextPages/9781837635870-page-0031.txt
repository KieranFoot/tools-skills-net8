Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET! 12 I have created PowerShell scripts to install and uninstall the Visual Studio Code extensions in the preceding table. You can find them at the following link: https://github.com/ markjprice/cs12dotnet8/tree/main/scripts/extension-scripts/. Understanding Visual Studio Code versions Microsoft releases a new feature version of Visual Studio Code (almost) every month and bug-fix ver- sions more frequently. For example: • Version 1.79.0, May 2023 feature release • Version 1.79.1, May 2023 bug fix release The version used in this book is 1.82.1, August 2023 bug fix release, but the version of Visual Studio Code is less important than the version of the C# Dev Kit or C# extension that you install. I recommend C# extension v2.8.23 or later and C# Dev Kit v0.5.150 or later. While the C# extension is not required, it provides IntelliSense as you type, code navigation, and de- bugging features, so it’s something that’s very handy to install and keep updated to support the latest C# language features. Keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code If you want to customize your keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code, then you can, as shown at the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings. I recommend that you download a PDF of Visual Studio Code keyboard shortcuts for your operating system from the following list: • Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf • macOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf • Linux: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf Understanding .NET “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” – George Santayana .NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin are related and overlapping platforms for developers used to build applications and services. If you are not familiar with the history of .NET, then I introduce you to each of these .NET concepts at the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/ch01-dotnet-history.md
