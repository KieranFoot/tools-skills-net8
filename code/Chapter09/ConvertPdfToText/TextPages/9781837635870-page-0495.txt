Working with Files, Streams, and Serialization 476 Understanding storage streams Some storage streams that represent a location where the bytes will be stored are described in Table 9.3: Namespace Class Description System.IO FileStream Bytes stored in the filesystem System.IO MemoryStream Bytes stored in memory in the current process System.Net.Sockets NetworkStream Bytes stored at a network location Table 9.3: Storage stream classes FileStream has been rewritten in .NET 6 to have much higher performance and reliabil- ity on Windows. You can read more about this at the following link: https://devblogs. microsoft.com/dotnet/file-io-improvements-in-dotnet-6/. Understanding function streams Function streams cannot exist on their own but can only be “plugged into” other streams to add func- tionality. Some are described in Table 9.4: Namespace Class Description This encrypts and decrypts System.Security.Cryptography CryptoStream the stream. GZipStream, These compress and System.IO.Compression DeflateStream decompress the stream. This sends credentials across System.Net.Security AuthenticatedStream the stream. Table 9.4: Function stream classes Understanding stream helpers Although there will be occasions where you need to work with streams at a low level, most often, you can plug helper classes into the chain to make things easier. All the helper types for streams implement IDisposable, so they have a Dispose method to release unmanaged resources. Some helper classes to handle common scenarios are described in Table 9.5: Namespace Class Description System.IO StreamReader This reads from the underlying stream as plain text. System.IO StreamWriter This writes to the underlying stream as plain text.
